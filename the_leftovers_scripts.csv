03,8 ,The Book of Nora,https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?t=53345&sid=1766bf46b509d0b9c82260f033d36cec,"Every one of us was touched
by the events of October 14th,

but no one more than
our honored speaker,

Nora Durst.

It's Kevin, right?

- Nora.
- Mm-hmm. Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you, too.

If that's a traffic ticket,
I can get you out of it.

- Divorce.
- Me too.

Maybe we should do dinner,
or something...

I would love that.

You should know, though,
I'm a f*cking mess.

My name is
Maria Carmen Rodriguez.

- Marilyn K. Oshima.

And I give my full consent
for the journey

- I'm about to take.
- To go wherever they went.

- They made these testimonials.
- They gave their names.

So I looked them up just
to see if any of them

were still around after they
supposedly got into this thing.

This thing that
zaps them with the radiation.

Every single one of them
is unaccounted for.

And what if they ask
why I came down here with you?

I'll say... we're in a toxic,
co-dependent relationship,

and we've both come to realize
that we're better off apart

than together.

You can't have a kid,
because then you'd have

no excuse.
You'd have to be okay.

No one would feel sorry for you.

I do not want people
to feel sorry for me.

Whoppin' hell now, Nora.

How long before you move
past it?

- Move past what?
- You lost your kids.

My kids are not dead!
They are just gone.

Then you should go
and be with them.

Okay.

Begin.

My name is Nora Elizabeth
Jamison Durst.

11/18/1979.

This is a copy of today's paper.

I hereby indemnify all individuals for
the procedure that's about to occur.

I'm of sound mind and body, and
I'm acting of my own free will.

- That's it.
- Stop.

Something wrong?

Nothing, it... it's fine.

What did she say?

She wants you to do it again.

Why do you want me
to do it again?

Because I do not believe you.

Excuse me?

Excuse me, but you're lying.

You're just...

You're just saying
what we want to hear.

You invited me here,

and then you rejected me.

But I sat outside your house all
night and I followed you here,

so you'd have no choice but to
let me get into your machine.

So, I don't give a shit
what you want to hear.

And I don't lie.

Can you say
your children's names?

- What?
- Your children.

Do you think you can say
their names?

Erin and Jeremy.

I meant in your statement.

Would you like to try again?

Okay.

My name is Nora Elizabeth
Jamison Durst.

I was born
on November 18th, 1979.

This is a copy of today's paper,

because today is the day
I'm leaving to be with them.

I'm leaving
to be with my children,

Erin and Jeremy.

I'm ready to go now.

We prefer to give
a more thorough orientation,

but since we were in the
process of moving on,

you'll just have
to bear with us.

Was that a person?

It's a fossil.

The person is gone.

Maybe they'll let you keep mine.

As soon as we've administered
your saline drip,

you will disrobe
outside the truck.

Once you are inside,
you will see

the event chamber at
the far end.

You just walk to it.

You may experience
nausea or discomfort

as you pass by
the undulating laser array

while it cycles up.

Do not touch the array.

Step inside the event chamber,

close the exit port behind you,

and turn the latch to the left.

Hard to the left.
It'll stick.

Then pull your knees
towards your chest

and hold them there.

- Okay?
- Okay.

We will be monitoring you
from inside there.

Once inside the event chamber,

you will be able to hear us

and we will be able to hear you.

When you're ready, we will
start the ignition sequence.

You will hear three tones.

After the third tone, the chamber
will fill up with fluid.

The fluid will have the
same consistency as water,

but it is not water.

It contains metals
that will be irradiated.

Once this occurs,
the fluid will solidify.

Do not ingest or breathe in
any of the fluid

as your lungs would also
solidify upon transport.

Can you hold your breath
for 30 seconds?

Yes.

Well...

then that's it.

Activity.

Pole dancing.

Um, noun.

Gecko.

Gecko.
Excellent.

Okay, last one.

Man's name.

Antonio.

Antonio.
Perfect.

Okay, here we go.

""Nora Elizabeth Jamison Durst,

age 417...""

""was vaporized by a consortium
of international physicists""

last Tuesday
outside Never Never Land.

""Miss Durst was born
and raised in Cairo, Egypt...""

- Mmm.
- ""...where she returned after college""

to squeeze a family...""

""her spiffy husband,
Doug Durst,""

and her beloved geese,
Jeremy and Erin.

Admired by her coworkers,

she was a longtime employee

""at the Department
of the Sudden Diarrhea.""

That's disgusting.

""In her spare time,""

Miss Durst enjoyed crosswords,

exposing frauds,
and pole dancing.

She is survived,
at least temporarily,

""by her terminally ill gecko,
Matthew Jamison.""

""As she lives on
in our memories,

and in the Great Antonio
in the sky.""

Mm.

""There will be no funeral
or memorial service.""

Mm.

Oh, God bless Matt Libs.

I couldn't ask
for a better obituary.

Happy to oblige.

You sending me those things
is what got me through

Hellfire and Damnation.

The horrible Bible camp
that Grandma and Pop-Pop

used to send me off to
in the Adirondacks?

It wasn't Hellfire
and Damnation,

it was Camp Holy Spirit.

Potato, pah-ta-toe.

You were so young
with the pigtails.

- What were you, eight years old?
- Seven.

Do you remember what you said to
me when you put me on the bus?

""Brush your teeth""?

You said...

You said that I was
the bravest girl on Earth.

And every time
you sent me a letter

with a new Matt Lib in it,

that's who
it was addressed to...

""The Bravest Girl
on Earth.""

I forgot about that.

You drive me f*cking nuts.

But you've always been
a great gecko, Matt.

If I was a great gecko, I'd be
trying to talk you out of this.

You're great because
you're not trying.

I'm scared.

I'll be fine.

Of course you will.
You always are.

I'm scared of what'll happen
when I go back to Mary.

And I'm scared of the chemicals

they're going to put in my body
to try and make me better, and...

I'm scared it won't work.

I'm scared of dying, Nora.

I'm scared my son
will grow up without me,

forget my face,

forget the sound of my voice.

But most of all, I'm
scared that I'll survive.

Because if I do...

how can I ever stand in front
of a room full of people

and convince them
that I have the answers

when I have no idea what the
f*ck I'm talking about.

Do you want to come
with me instead?

I think, dear sister,

that defeats the purpose.

What are you going
to tell people about me?

About what happened here?

Whatever you want me to.

Are you ready?

Of course she's ready.

She's the bravest girl on Earth.

- Give it to me!
- No!

It's mine! You don't
need it anymore!

Give her the blanket.

Two hands like a big girl.
Good deal.

I'm hungry, Mom.
I'm hungry!

I'm hungry, too! No
phones at the table.

- Yours is out, too.
- I'm waiting to hear about the job.

- This is important, too.
- I want food!

I want food!
I want food!

- It's coming, buddy.
- I want food!

- Jeremy. Hey.
- I want food!

- I want food!
- Cut it out.

God damn it, I said two hands!

Nora, can you hear me?

Yes.

Your brother is here with us.

Hello, Nora.

Hi, Matt.

I love you.

I love you, too.

We're going to begin, Nora.

I was worried you'd forgotten.

Don't usually get
so many so close together.

Love is in the air.

A little extra for your trouble.

Sarah, does the name Kevin
mean anything to you?

No.

Are you sure?

Because a man calling himself
that came by yesterday.

He had a photo.
A photo of you.

Did you tell him anything?

No, of course not.

But I think he knew I was lying.

Nora?

Kevin.

Kevin Garvey.

I don't know if you remember me.

I was the chief of police
in Mapleton.

We don't know each other
really well.

We only talked
a couple times, really.

There was this dance,

a Christmas dance
at the high school.

We just had a really
nice conversation.

Yeah.

In the hallway.

I don't expect you to remember.

It was a long time ago.

What are you doing?

Well, um, I've been
kind of wandering

around Australia on vacation.

I... just kind of getting
off the grid.

You know, trying to avoid
the touristy stuff.

I like to get a little
lost, you know?

Anyway, I was...
I'm in that little town

down the road, and I saw
you riding your bike.

And I thought to myself, ""Holy
shit, I think that's Nora Durst.""

And, so, I found out
where you lived.

And here you are.

- That's not what happened.
- Sorry?

You showed a picture of me
to the nun at the convent.

That's how you found out
where I lived.

- Why would I have a picture of you?
- I just came from there.

- She told me that you asked if I...
- Are you married?

- What?
- Are you married or are you seeing somebody?

I noticed you weren't
wearing a wedding ring.

And I saw that
they were having a dance

in town tonight.

And when I saw you
riding your bike,

it reminded me...

how I had always wished
I had asked you

to dance.

Anyway, I know it sounds crazy,
but I felt a connection.

So, you know, here we are
in the middle of nowhere

bumping into each other, and
I'm only here for the night,

and I figured, uh, you know,

if I didn't ask you
to dance tonight...

I'll never forgive myself.

You need to leave now.

Okay.

I get it.

A guy you barely remember
shows up on your doorstep,

asks you to go
on a date with him, but...

I had to try.

Please just go.

I'll be there
if you change your mind.

They shut down
all of Main Street,

so you're not gonna
be able to miss it.

It's good to see you, Nora.

- Hello?
- Did you tell him?

- Nora?
- Did you tell him?

I... I don't understand
what you're asking me.

Kevin, f*cking Kevin.
He's here.

- He found me.
- What? He's... he's there in Australia?

Did you tell him
where I was, Laurie?

No.
No, I didn't.

- Because if you did, just say so, and I...
- I didn't.

We established boundaries
the first time you called me.

Clear boundaries.

I don't tell you
about the people here,

and I don't tell
the people here about you.

I would never betray that, Nora.

Then how did he find me?

How did he say he found you?

He said that he was here
on vacation

and he spotted me.

And then he came to my house,
and he knocked on my door,

and he acted like we were
just casual acquaintances

from Mapleton years back,

like... like we were
never together.

Like... like none of it
happened.

Huh.

""Huh?""
What's that mean? ""Huh?""

Well, I'm just surprised,
that's all.

It's a very un-Kevin-like
thing to do.

Is he crazy?

Does he seem crazy?

No.
He seemed happy.

Huh.

Would you please
stop f*cking saying that?

Okay.

Why... why is he doing this?

I don't know.

Did he say anything else?

- He asked me to a dance.
- A... a dance?

I guess there's a dance
in town tonight,

and he asked me to go.

And you don't want to?

- No.
- What do you want?

Well, I want him
to leave me alone.

- Then why are you calling me?
- What?

Well, I can't make him
leave you alone.

I'm half a world away,
so why did you call me?

I called you because I thought
you told him where I was.

Come on, you know
I didn't tell him that.

You called me because
you wanted me to say

it's okay to go to the dance.

I do not want to go
to the f*cking dance!

Gotcha.

But if you did, it's okay.

Jesus Christ, Laurie.

Same time next week?

Where are your beads?

- Excuse me?
- Your beads. You need beads.

- Here, take one of mine.
- No, thank you.

You came.

It's a wedding.

I know.

You told me it was a dance.

People are dancing.

- Were you even invited?
- Yeah, of course I was.

Um... that's Eddie.

He can take a tractor apart,

put it back together
blindfolded.

Allegedly.

And that's Aggie.

She was in the Army.

She left.
Too many rules.

I bumped into them
at the hotel bar.

They told me if I didn't come,
they'd be angry with me.

How did you find me, Kevin?

I'm on vacation in Australia.

I saw you ride by on your bike.

This is the middle of nowhere.

Why would you come here
on vacation?

My father came Down Under
a while back

and told me
it was an amazing place,

so I just wanted
to see for myself.

So, you're saying you've
never been here before.

This is your first time
in Australia.

Uh-huh.

You're really
gonna keep this up?

Keep what up?

So, you and me,
we only talked that one time

at that Christmas dance
in Mapleton.

- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

What about the courthouse?

We got our divorces on the same
day and ran into each other.

I asked you to go to Miami.

- You asked me to go to Miami?
- Miami.

Yes.

But we were strangers?

Yes.

And you're giving me a hard time
about inviting you to a dance?

It's a wedding.

You must have me confused
with someone else.

Because if you asked me
to go to Miami with you,

I definitely would've gone.

I love Miami.

So... so,
you never left?

You've been a cop
in Mapleton all this time?

Uh-huh.

Then you knew my brother,
Matt Jamison.

I was hoping you were
gonna come to the funeral.

We said our goodbyes in person.

It was a beautiful service.

Over 400 people came.

Mary gave the eulogy.

She really loved him.

There was a lot to love.

How are Jill and Tom?

You remember my kids' names?

Yeah.

I remember.

It's a little creepy,
but I am impressed.

Jill's great.

She married a great guy.

They have a daughter together.

Penelope.
About a year old now.

And I'm a f*cking grandpa.

Tommy's marriage
didn't work out so great.

But he landed on his feet,
like he always does.

- What about you?
- Me?

Did you ever get married again?

No.

Why not?

Because I'm still holding
a candle for you.

I find that hard to believe.

My mom died when I was nine.

My dad never remarried, so...

People hold candles, Nora.

- How is your dad?
- He's fantastic.

Jesus!

- He's 91 and he's still kicking.
- He must be immortal.

Oh, runs in the family, right?

- I'm not immortal.
- Oh?

Says who?

My cardiologist.

I had a condition.

It was undiagnosed
my whole life.

A couple years back,
I had a heart attack.

A pretty...
Pretty bad one.

But if they hadn't
diagnosed the condition,

then I wouldn't
have known I had had it,

and blah, blah, blah, so...

They just cut me open,
put in a pacemaker.

- Really?
- Yeah, really.

Wanna see my scar?

She came!

You said she wouldn't come.

Oh, I'm just as surprised
as you are.

- Oops.
- Aggie, this is Nora.

- Nora, this is Aggie.
- Congratulations.

- He didn't think you were coming.
- Yeah, you mentioned that.

Nice of you to get all
dressed up for my wedding.

I'm sorry, I didn't know
it was a wedding.

I'm just f*cking with you.

She's very serious.

Yeah.

Wouldn't have it any other way.

All right,
that's enough chitchat.

Did you write your messages?

I gave mine to the nun.

Hi.

What about you, sweetheart?

Want to write a message of
love to send out to the world?

No, thank you.

And she's a romantic, too.

All right,
let's get these over with!

Where the f*ck's Eddie?

What did you tell her about us?

I told her I had
a crush on a girl

and I wanted to chase after her,

but I didn't know what to say.

All right,
everyone, settle down.

I'm talking now!

Oi! Listen up,
f*ck!

All right, dearest
family, beloved friends,

and Russell.

Oi!

Eddie and I just
wanna thank you all

for being here
on our special day

to drink our alcohol
free of charge.

Sweetheart, I am so happy

that we're gonna spend the
rest of our lives together.

And now that you've married
me, I have a confession.

I think I might be pregnant.

- No!
- Not to worry, love.

- It's yours, probably.
- Oh!

All right, let's get
to the ooey-gooey.

We have gathered your notes

and attached them
to these beautiful birds.

And now we are
going to set them free

so they can fly off
to every corner of the world,

spreading those messages of
love to people everywhere.

Aw!

All right, Sister.

Release the birds!



What did you write?

That's for me to know and some
lonely Eskimo to find out.

Isn't that romantic, eh?

Yeah, let's hear it
for the love birds!

Whoo!

See, if only life
was just about love.

But it's about temptation.

It's about failure.

It's about weakness.

You know what I'm talking
about, don't you, Sister?

It's about sin, yeah.

And everybody here knows I've
made my fair share of mistakes,

but there is a very big difference
between a sin and a mistake.

Because a mistake
is just f*cking up, hmm?

But a sin...
Hoo-hoo.

A sin is when you know
something is wrong

and you do it anyway.

So, Aggie,

my darling wife,

my sun and my stars,

I look forward to a lifetime
of f*cking up with you.

But I hereby swear
I will never sin again.

Aw!

Now bring out that f*cking goat!

Yeah!

Hello!
In biblical times,

a goat was designated
to be driven into the desert

with the sins
of the community upon it.

So...

let these beads
represent our sins.

Unburden yourselves, friends.

Then Russell will
drive the scapegoat

deep into the bush,
far from here,

so we can start over

untainted by our past mistakes.

At least they didn't
sacrifice it.

Have you ever seen somebody
sacrifice a goat?

No.

That'd be weird.

Three, four.

One, two, three, four. Al,
don't count, don't say four,

'cause I'm gonna be on you.

Will you dance with me?

How did you find me, Kevin?

I'm on vacation in Australia.

- I saw you
ride by on your bike.

I can't do this.

Why not?

Because it's not true.

Evening.

- Sarah.
- What did you do with my birds?

I let them go
just like I always do.

- What's wrong?
- What's wrong is that they didn't come back.

- Did you give them the seed that I gave you?
- Yes, of course.

And... and you didn't feed them right
before you let them go, did you?

No, of course not.
I did everything the same.

- Then where are they?
- I don't know.

Those birds are trained
to do one thing,

just one thing,
and that's to come home,

so you must've done
something different.

Maybe they're delivering
the messages of love.

It's great that
your newlyweds believe

that a bird
with a range of 50 miles

is gonna carry their
stupid poetry to Timbuktu,

but don't sell
that bullshit to me.

I'm not trying
to sell you anything.

It's just a nicer story.

Who was that man?

What man?

The man I just saw leaving.

You mean Father Brian.

He's the only man
permitted in the convent.

Does Father Brian
ride a motorcycle?

- No.
- Well, this man did.

And he was climbing a ladder down
from that room right up there.

Oh, well, that's strange.

Is that your room?

It might be.

But I certainly haven't seen
any men on ladders.

You just had sex with him.

- Oh, no, I didn't.
- You did.

- Did not.
- Then swear to God.

All right.

I swear to God.

You're a f*cking liar!

I saw you dancing with that man.

That man you said
you didn't know.

I'll pray for the safe
return of your birds.

Don't waste your breath.

Oh, God.

Oh, God.

Ah!

Oh, shh, shh, shh...

I know.
Okay.

Shh.

Hey, you hungry?

Hey!

Eat this, you idiot.

Here.

Come on.

You wanna know
how I found you, Nora?

You want the truth?

When Matt told me you were
gone, I didn't believe him.

Or I couldn't.

I just... I had this feeling
that you were still alive...

and that I would see you again.

And then...
Then Matt died

and you weren't even
at the funeral.

And that should've convinced me,

but I couldn't believe the last
time I saw you or talked to you

was in that f*cking hotel room

that night I b*rned
his f*cking book.

I was so sure
you were still alive,

even though everyone else in the world
said that you were f*cking dead.

God, I...

I had to do something about it.

So I decided that
I was gonna look for you.

I was gonna start
right where I lost you.

Every year, I have
two weeks of vacation,

and every year,
I come to f*cking Australia

and I show your picture
to everybody I meet.

""Do you know this woman?

Have you ever
seen her before?""

And they all just look at me and
they shake their heads and they say,

""Oh, I'm sorry.""

Everybody's so f*cking sorry.

But I couldn't stop.

Every year,
I would say to myself,

""I can't do this.""

I'm not doing this.

""Never again.""

But every year,
I would come back.

Because...

Because I couldn't stop.

And a couple days ago...

I showed your picture
to that nun...

and I saw it in her eyes.

She recognized you.

She knew you.

And when I saw you...

I couldn't believe it.

There you were.

And I was so...

Oh, but I didn't know
what to say...

or where to start,

and so I just thought,
""Oh, f*ck it. I'll erase it.

Just erase it all and maybe that
would give us another chance.""

But you were right.

It's not true.

That's how I found you, Nora.

I...

I refused to believe
you were gone.

You want some tea?

What?

I was gonna make a cup of tea.
You want some?

Okay.

You want one?

No. I quit.

Heart.

So, that part is true?

Mm-hmm.

That part is true.

What else is true?

Everything I said
about Matt's funeral.

Everything I told you
about Jill and Tommy...

my father.

Did you move back to Mapleton?

No.

Still in Jarden.

In our house.

Anyone still call it Miracle?

Not so much.

How are the Murphys?

Uh, Michael's pretty much
running the church now.

I see Erika there
every once in a while.

She's great.

And John and Laurie
still live next door.

I talk to Laurie sometimes.

- What?
- Every once in a while.

Just when I need to.

- She knows you're here?
- Don't be mad at her.

She's my therapist.
She wasn't allowed to tell you.

Why didn't you tell me?

Because you were right, Kevin.

What you said in the hotel,

the last time we saw each other.

I needed to be with my kids.

Oh, no, I didn't mean that...

You meant it,
and you were right, Kevin.

There were always gonna be
bulletproof vests,

hugs from holy men...

tattoos to cover up.

But those were just ways
to deal with what I lost.

I needed a way to get them back.

I knew there was a chance
it would k*ll me,

but I made my peace with that.

And I said goodbye
to my brother...

and I climbed right in.

And then you changed your mind.

No.

I didn't change my mind.

I went through.

I was in the parking lot,

naked...

curled up like a baby.

It was the same parking lot
I'd just been in,

except there were no trucks...

no people, no nothing.

It was cold,
so I started to walk.

I walked by empty houses...

abandoned buildings.

And I found a store,

so I went in and there
were clothes there...

Clothes hanging on racks...

So I got dressed
and I got back to walking.

I walked long enough
to convince myself

that I was the only thing
alive in that place.

And then night came,

and I saw lights,
so I went to them.

It was a house,

and there was a man
and a women there.

They were kind

and they told me...

the man told me
that seven years earlier,

he was in a supermarket and every single
person disappeared except for him.

And the women told me
that she lost her husband,

her three daughters,

and all eight
of her grandchildren.

And that's when I understood.

Over here, we lost some of them.

But over there,
they lost all of us.

So, I went and did
what I came there to do.

I went to find my kids.

Planes don't really fly
over there.

They have enough resources,
just not enough pilots.

So, I found a boat
that would take me.

No boats go directly
from Australia to New York,

so it took me
a long time to get there.

A long time.

But I finally did.

And I walked through Mapleton.

I walked through
the town where I grew up...

where my parents died,

and Matt.

Where you and I met.

Most of the houses
were overgrown with weeds,

but the streetlights
still turned on at night,

and that made me
feel less stupid

about expecting them
to still be there.

Still there in the very same
house where I lost them.

When I got there, I stood
behind a tree across the street

and I waited because I was too
scared to go up and knock.

And then, after a while,

the door opened.

At first,
I didn't recognize them.

A tall teenage boy...

with curly hair...

and a girl,

maybe 11.

They were my children.

And then my husband came out,
and he was with a woman.

She was pretty.

She was pretty,
and they were all smiling.

They were...

happy.

And I understood
that here in this place,

they were the lucky ones.

In a world full of orphans,

they still had each other.

And I was a ghost.

I was a ghost
who had no place there.

And that, Kevin,
is when I changed my mind.

The physicists
who sent me through

told me the first person
to use the machine

was the guy who invented it.

His name was
Dr. Van Eeghen.

I'm pretty sure
they were making fun of me,

but they said when I went over

that I should look
him up, so I did.

That took a long time, too.

But I found him

and I asked him
to make another machine

because he already knew how.

And he asked me
if I had come all that way,

why in God's name
did I wanna go back?

And I told him it's because
I didn't belong there.

So, he built it.

And I came back through.

I came back here.

Did I...

think about you?

Did I wanna call you?

Did I wanna be with you, Kevin?

Of course I did.

But so much time had passed.

It was too late.

And I knew that
if I told you what happened...

that you would never believe me.

I believe you.

You do?

Why wouldn't I believe you?

You're here.

I'm here."

move past it?

You lost your kids!

My kids are not dead.
They are just gone.

Then you should go be with them.

You want to drown Kevin

so that he can go to this place
where the dead people are.

None of this is real.

This is more real than
it's ever been.

And while he's there,
he's gonna learn a song

from one of the dead people

and he's gonna bring that song
back to you so you can sing it

and stop the biblical flood
that's gonna happen tomorrow.

And you think that
Ivy's in this place, too?

I want her to
know that she was loved.

I'm so sorry about
your children.

When we found their bodies,
their shoes were missing.

When Kevin talks to them,
he's gonna ask them

where they put their shoes.

- Where's everybody?
- Inside.

I drugged their food.

Are you scared?

Where I went, it was real.

What line of work you in?

I'm an international assassin.

Maybe I was dead,
but I had never felt so alive.

Nope. I'm not scared.

What do you want?

I wanna be cremated.

You got it.
No problem.

- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

Because Matt's gonna wanna
bury me next to Mom and Dad

in the old Jamison plot
about a mile from here.

- He's gonna put up a f*ght.
- f*ck Matt.

If you wanna be cremated,
I'll make sure you're cremated.

We'll burn you up good.

What about you?

- I wanna be stuffed.
- Excuse me?

Stuffed. Like, you
know, taxidermy.

You don't have to
display me prominently.

Just stick me in the corner
of the bedroom or something.

- I'll get it.
- No, she'll settle.

Okay, I'll stuff you.

On one condition.

sh**t.

I get to put a beard on you.

Why?

Because I'm the one that has to
have sex with that abomination.

I'm gonna dress it up
how I want.

You want me to grow a beard.

Do I?

Shit!
This is it.

Wake up.
Wake the f*ck up.

Wake up. Wake up, wake
up, wake up, wake up!

God damn it! Shit, this is it.
It's today!

It's today.
Wake up!

- What's going on?
- What happened?

What happened is your wife f*cking
drugged us, talked him out of it.

Now the g*dd*mn flood's coming,

and we're all gonna f*cking die.

- His horse is here.
- Huh?

- His horse is here.
- What?

Oh, Jesus Christ!

Help me!

Come on! Get him off that!

Get him out!

Get him the f*ck out!

Get him off, God damn it!

Get him off!

Stop!

Stop!

- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

I'm doing
what you asked me to do.

I thought we'd do it together.

I know what you want me to say to Evie.
Anything else?

No.

My children.

You saw the photos.
Do you remember their names?

Liam, Abigail, David,
Samantha, Jimmy.

Thank you.

You want me to find
Christopher Sunday,

learn the song, so you can
stop the flood, right?

Right.

Then let go.

Kevin Harvey.

No. No! Please, please,
please, please.

Don't.

Kilo Hotel is secure.

I repeat, Kilo Hotel is secure.

Mr. Harvey.

Is that your place up there?

Yeah.

Well, are you gonna
invite me in?

You got any other
reflective surfaces?

TV screens, glassware,
stainless steel pots?

Uh, no.

The f*ck are these?

Uh, my sunglasses.

No reflective surfaces.

Do not look into them
no matter what.

That's how they found you.

Yeah. Right.

""He stood on the bow
of The Merciful...""

the water endlessly stretching
to the infinite horizon

as he contemplated the impossible
distance between them,

""but he would not stop
until he found her.""

What, are you writing a book?

There's no shame in it.

What you do in your time
is your business.

Unfortunately,

folks in your line of work
don't get to retire.

I'm an assassin.

Yes, sir,
Mr. Harvey.

So, let's get
assassinating, shall we?

Who's the target?

President.

- The president?
- Of the United States.

And based on our intel,
in, well, just under two hours

he's gonna start an
unsanctioned nuclear w*r.

And you are the only man alive who
can get to him before he does.

Mr. Harvey, you gonna have
trouble putting him down?

No.

But I'm gonna need
something in exchange.

Okay. What?

I need to find some people.

Five kids...

Liam, Abigail, Samantha,
David, and Jimmy Playford.

I also need to talk to a woman
named Evangeline Murphy

and a man...
Christopher Sunday.

Christopher Sunday?

The Prime Minister of Australia?

Yeah.

Man, you want that kind
of high-level access,

you're gonna have to talk
to the boss yourself.

Here. Stick that
in your ear.

You'll hear him, he'll hear you.

He'll talk you through
this whole shit show.

Now, the evac chopper
is two minutes out.

You're gonna wanna
get yourself dressed.

Testing, one, two, three.

Testing, one, two, three.

Are you receiving me?

- Who is this?
- Mission control.

Do I know you?

You made me sing.

I met you on the bridge.

And do you remember,
Mr. Harvey,

what I said to you
that night on the bridge

when I whispered in your ear?

You said I was the most
powerful man in the world.

g*dd*mn right, you are.

Now, go pick up that piece of
mirror and look at yourself.

I thought I wasn't supposed
to look in reflective...

Shut up. You wanna get
what you came here for?

Pick up that mirror
and look at yourself.

Yeah! Yeah!

Here we go! Whoo!

Um...

G'day...
G'day, Melbourne.

Um...

Thank you for the warm welcome.

This isn't my first time visiting
the other side of the world.

Every time I'm here,

it gets harder and harder
to leave.

Yeah! Yeah!

Uh...

I've come to talk to you today
about marriage.

For millennia,
we have believed marriage

as a cornerstone
of our civilization.

Our party, however,
does not share this opinion.

We believe that marriage is the
single most destructive idea

ever conceived of by humankind.

That's why in my first
hundred days in office,

I introduced legislation...

I'm the president.

Um, and as... as president,
my friends,

tradition is powerful.

In the early days
of our movement,

it was mandatory that all
members smoke cigarettes

and refrain from speaking,

but we realized
those traditions were stupid.

Now, it's an understandable
concern.

If there is no marriage,
what happens to the family?

What happens to the children?

And so we decided to have
a worldwide essay contest

to answer that question
in their own words.

We have one of the finalists
from that contest here

with us today.

He is joined by his brothers
and sisters for his essay

titled ""Why I Don't Need
a Mommy and a Daddy Anymore.""

Please welcome
Australia's own...

um...

Liam Playford.

Liam...

why aren't you wearing
any shoes?

That's weird. Yeah.

Your shoes.
You're not wearing any shoes.

Where are they?

Why does it matter?

Well, somebody wants...

Somebody in your family
wants to know.

But you said there is no family.

Sir, we have a situation.

We need to move you now.

No, wait.
I, uh...

I have to... I have to
talk to that girl.

No, we haven't
got time for that, sir.

We need to get you
to a secure location.

I'm not going f*cking anywhere
until I talk to that girl.

Okay, I'll get her.

Get him to the car.

This way, please, sir.

Mr. President, Chief
of Staff on the phone.

- Hello?
- Mr. President,

it appears Ukrainian separatists

have taken control
of an armed nuclear submarine,

and they'll have launch
capability within two hours.

You're being brought
to a bunker,

which you will access with your
unique biometrics once inside.

- Sorry, my unique biometrics?
- Yes, sir.

The door can only be unlocked
by you and you alone

unless you have
an identical twin brother,

which would be ridiculous.

Yeah, that would be ridiculous.

Sir, do I have your permission
to move us to DEFCON 2?

Um, what DEFCON
are we at right now?

- We're at DEFCON 3, sir.
- Uh, DEFCON 2 is worse?

Yes, sir, it's worse.

Let's jut stay
where we're at right now

until we have more, um, intel.

With all due respect, sir,

I don't think
the Secretary of Defense

is going to be happy about that.

Yeah, well,
f*ck the Secretary of Defense.

Mr. President,

the girl you asked for.

- She's coming with me.
- Sir, she's a civilian.

She can't travel
in the presidential limo.

She's coming with me alone.

That's an order.

Looks like rain.

Do you know who I am?

Yes.

Do you know that I'm not the
President of the United States?

I sure do.

I have a message for you
from your father.

My father?

John.

He wants me to tell you...

he wants you to know...

that you're loved.

Is there anything
you want me to tell him?

Are you f*cking serious?

My father was m*rder...

My mother, my brother...

All of them gone in an instant

because of a drone strike
ordered by your administration.

No. N-no, that's not
what happened.

You were k*ll.

What?

I'm not dead.

I'm right f*cking here, assh*le.

You said you knew
that I wasn't the president.

You're not!
You're just a puppet.

That speech you just gave?
Were those even your words?

Because it didn't sound like you
believed a single thing you were saying.

You just do
what they tell you to do.

- That's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

What do you want?

Are you okay?

Stop!

Stop the car!

You need to stop the car!

All right, stand back.

Give him some air.

I was just with Evie.

You... you saw her?

I delivered your message.

Your children were there, too.

All of them?

Yeah, all of them.

They were all okay?

They didn't know
what happened to their shoes.

Did you get the song?

I was working on it.

Why'd you pull me
out of the pond?

There is no pond.

The whole f*cking ranch
is flooded.

Take me to the bathroom.

- Whoa, hold on.
- You can't keep doing this.

- Yes, he can.
- No, look at him!

You got what you wanted.
Now you're worried about him?

Out there is the g*dd*mn flood.

That's why we're
f*cking doing this.

It's not why he's doing this.

Why else would I be doing this?

I don't know.
Why would you?

- Out!
- No. No!

Come on! Kevin!

- Dad, stop.
- Don't do this!

- Kevin!
- Everyone's got a f*cking opinion.

- Kevin! Dad, stop. Let's go.

You okay?

I'm cold.

If I could do this
instead of you,

I would.

I know.

But the secure location

can only be accessed
by my exact biometrics.

Is... is that supposed
to make sense to me?

It doesn't make sense to me.

I love you, son.

I love you, too.

You're gonna have to
hold me down.

You all right, sir?

Yeah. I need to talk to the
Australian prime minister.

- Sorry?
- The Australian prime minister.

Christopher Sunday. I need
to talk to him right now.

Well, sir, there's a secure
comms room inside the bunker.

We just need to confirm your ID,

and you can talk
to whoever you want.

Just wanna try the scanner
again, please, sir.

Yeah.

Identity confirmed.

Excellent.

Now your penis, please, sir.

- My what?
- Your penis.

Place it on the other
scanner, please, sir.

Why?

Mr. President, due to
advancements in plastic surgery,

anyone with enough resources
can copy a person's face.

But your, uh...
Your penis, sir,

well, they're not gonna
go to that length.

Identity confirmed.

Confirmed.

- Can we go in now?
- Just the three authentication questions, sir.

What was the name of your
favorite childhood pet?

We didn't have one.
My mom was allergic.

Correct.

Your favorite movie?

""Godfather.""

Part two.

Correct.

Name of your
Secretary of Defense?

Um...

Sir, I need a name.

Patti Levin.

Correct.

Good to see you,
Mr. President.

I wish the circumstances
were different,

but it appears the shit
has hit the fan, sir.

Let's get to the situation room.

Mr. President,
for reasons I cannot fathom,

we remain at DEFCON 3.

This is the case
containing the nuclear football,

which will give you
remote launch capability.

What's in that one?

Never mind about that.

Just pray we don't
have to open it.

Sir, in order to arm the device,

you need to verbally
take us down to DEFCON 1.

You are aware
of the situation, yes?

- Yeah, of course...
- So, you know, sir,

that Ukrainian separatists
have seized control

of a nuclear submarine.

They will be w*apon hot
in less than an hour.

Our only option
is to strike first,

which is why you need
to take us down to DEFCON 1.

Uh, I have to make
a phone call first.

To who?

The Prime Minister of Australia.

Gentlemen, can the president
and I have the room, please?

Yes, if you can...

What the f*ck
is wrong with you?!

All this time,
years of planning,

we are minutes away
from making this happen,

and you are dicking around
about DEFCON 1!

- I don't have...
- You don't have any what?

You don't have any balls?

What?!

Sorry to interrupt,
Mr. President,

but the vice president is here

and she's demanding
to speak to you.

She?

f*ck her.

Tell her to go away.

She doesn't know about this.

Let her in.

Yes, sir, of course.

Madam Vice President.

You're being played, sir.

- Wha... what?
- You're being played.

I just got off the phone
with the Kremlin

who confirms that
there is no submarine,

no separatists.

This is a smoke screen.

You have been fed bogus intel.

I don't get fed, I feed.

And you clearly have no g*dd*mn
idea what's happening around here.

Then enlighten me.

I couldn't enlighten you with
a f*cking thousand-watt bulb.

- Tell her about the plan.
- I'm not telling her jack shit.

If you want me to bring us
down to DEFCON 1, tell her.

Fine.

We are going to vaporize

every man, woman,
and child on the planet.

It's the seventh anniversary
of the departure,

and there is reasonable
expectation out there

that the world's gonna end.

So, we're gonna fire
our nukes at the Russians

and they're gonna retaliate,
and then that's it.

We're all torched.

No one wakes up tomorrow disappointed
that nothing f*cking happened.

We give the people what they're
too chickenshit to do themselves,

what they elected us for.

We give them what they want.

And they want to die.

Well, that's not gonna work.

You can't launch without going
through the Fisher Protocol.

You know about
the Fisher Protocol?

Of course I do.

Prove it.

It's an ethical deterrent.

The nuclear launch key was surgically
embedded into the heart of a volunteer.

In order for the president

to be able to blow up millions of
people with the push of a button,

he has to extract that key

by m*rder
the volunteer himself.

But since I don't see
that volunteer here,

you can't launch shit.

What?

The volunteer is coming through the
east entrance of this facility

in 15 minutes.

And how is he gonna make it
through the security door?

He's my identical twin brother.

Well, it sounds like you two have
really thought this through.

I guess I should go
handle my affairs.

I guess you should.

Mr. President.

Yeah.

All righty, sir.

May we go down to DEFCON 1 now?

I just need to make my call.



You can make your call after
you take us to DEFCON 1.

Just say it into the device.

We're at DEFCON 1.

What the f*ck!

What the f*ck?

You can't leave, sir.

Your order initiated
a full lockdown.

I told you I had to make
a f*cking call!

Hey!

Do you have eyes
on the entrance?

- Yeah, I see it.
- Good.

Take out the Secret Service
agents and get in there.

There are no
Secret Service agents.

It's a trap.
They want me to go in.

They wanna cut me open.

Do you think I don't know that?

Well, if you knew that, why the
f*ck wouldn't you tell me?

Because I'm covering my asset.

- What asset?
- I have someone on the inside.

Leave your w*apon,
enter the door,

and they'll take care of you
once you're inside.

You want me to go in there
without a g*n?

""Hence it comes about that all unarmed
prophets have been victorious,

and all armed prophets
have been destroyed.""

That's from Machiavelli.

Put your faith in me,
Mr. Harvey.

Identity confirmed.

Stop right there!

Stop! Down!

Down on the stairs.
Get down!

Show us your hands!

- Show us your f*cking hands!
- Here!

- Don't move.
- Did you f*cking sell me out?

Don't you f*cking move.

Hey, are you there?

I said don't f*cking move!

Jesus.

You look just f*cking like him.

The president is
in the situation room.

It's in lockdown,
but the code is 6969.

And please make sure you f*cking
k*ll the Secretary of Defense.

- Where's the comms room?
- What?

The comms room.
I need to make a call.

Do you know
what's inside of you?

Yes.

Then you know that the
president will not hesitate

to cut you open and pull it out.

I mean, I know this man.

He is cold and he is merciless.

You think he gives
a shit about you

if he's willing
to end the world?

I thought that's
what you people wanted.

They're all liars.

They say they don't
believe in love

and they don't feel pain.

I feel pain.

And I'm in love.

I'm in love with the most
wonderful man I have ever known.

Uh-huh.

And who's that?

His name is God.

Tell her I love her, too.

Where's the comms room?

What is it with you
and the f*cking comms room?

I thought you were an assassin.

I mean, who do you need
to communicate with?

Well, maybe I'm in love, too.

Oh, please.

Where is the comms room?

It's f*cking up the hall,
to the right!

- What's happening?
- What was that noise?

I don't know. You tell me.
You're God.

That was
just a pick-up line.

Did you f*cking k*ll her?

Hey. Hey, Harvey!

Hey! Harvey!

Mr. President.

You shaved.

I need to talk to the Prime
Minister of Australia.

Christopher Sunday.

Is there a problem, Officer?

No, sir.

He'll come out here,
Mr. President.

- Give us the room.
- Sir, this is my post.

Give us the f*cking room.

Hello.

Hello.

Are you Christopher Sunday?

Yes.

My name is Kevin,

and I know this
is gonna sound crazy...

but you're not the Prime
Minister of Australia.

My father,

he came to you for a song.

A song to stop the rain.

There's no song
to stop the rain.

What?

I told your father,
but he didn't listen.

No. No, no, no. Look, you
have to give me something.

I have to bring him something.

He... he needs this.

- There's a flood...
- Do you believe that?

Believe what?

Do you believe your father

can sing a song
and stop the flood?

No.

Then why are you here?

Don't move.

Mr. President,

can I have
my glasses back, please?

Sounds like they got him.

I don't wanna do this anymore.

Do what,
Mr. President?

Stop f*cking calling me that!

I'm not the president!

You're not the f*cking
Secretary of Defense.

Oh, yes, yes, I am.

You named me
Secretary of Defense.

You were asked who did you
want in this position,

and you named me.

You summoned me
out of retirement

and I came back

because I owed you.

You helped me, Kevin.

And now I'm here to help you.

Help me how?

Well, what do you want?

I wanna go home.

Do you?

What?

It's just that

you've been known
to say that before,

and yet you keep leaving
home and coming here.

I'm sensing a lot
of internal contradictions

from you, Kevin.

It sounds like something you
need to work out with yourself.

I'm gonna take these off

because I know you're here

of your own free will,

and the last thing you wanna do

is hurt yourself.

All right, gentlemen.

Let's get to
the hard part, shall we?

I, Patricia Levin,

in my capacity
as Secretary of Defense

hereby invoke
the Fisher Protocol,

overriding the Heart Deterrent

pursuant to the nuclear
command authority

granted by Article Two, Section
Two of the US Constitution.

The president
shall make an incision

two inches below the sternum
of the volunteer... that's you...

Whereupon the president,

gaining access
from beneath the ribcage,

shall manually extract
the launch key

from behind the left atrium.

In recognition of his service,

the volunteer shall receive a
posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor

applicable if Congress exists,

which it will not.

May God have mercy on your soul
if there is a God,

which there is not.

I'm not f*cking k*ll him.

Good, because I'm not
f*cking letting him.

Gentlemen, language.

f*ck you!

I'm not understanding
the problem.

The problem is that
this is stupid!

I don't care about
any of this bullshit.

- It doesn't make any sense!
- It doesn't?

No! Why the f*ck would I
volunteer to be cut open?

I don't know.
Why would you?

- I wouldn't!
- And yet here you are.

Knowing full well
what is inside of you,

you kept moving forward
towards this very room

and the one person powerful
enough to take it out.

I think you should tell him
about the book you wrote.

What book?

The romance novel.

That's him. He... he wrote it.
That's him.

- What? No. N-no, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

It's the one that was
in the typewriter

- in the f*cking beach house.
- I know.

- I was there, but it's not f*cking mine.
- Boys, boys.

I think we can all agree
you both wrote the same book.

No, we didn't!

Well, I'm sorry
it's come to this,

but I have no choice.

I received a call from the CIA

that the president
was keeping a secret journal

hidden behind the portrait of
Millard Fillmore in the Oval.

As this was clearly
a national security issue,

I had no choice
but to procure it.

I'd like you
to read this for us.

No.

What about you?

No.

Fine, I'll do it myself.

Sorry, I just need my glasses.

For f*ck's sake.

""Untitled Romance Novel.""

- ""Chapter One.""
- Just read the last page.

Ending's better.

""The port was alive
with strange faces.""

It was dawn by the time
he found an old salt

willing to part with a vessel

for what bullion he had left...

A cutter with a Bermuda rig
called 'The Merciful, '

its sails ragged and ripped,

its compass cracked,

its rotten hull just barely
able to cut the breakers.

But it would be enough
to make his escape.

It wasn't for another hour when
he was a mile from the docks

that his thoughts
turned back to her.

He imagined her alone.

By now, she would've searched
the house and found it empty.

She had suspected it all along,

and now she knew
he was a coward.

A coward dressed in the
uniform of a brave man.

Brave enough to cross two oceans
and a continent to find her,

to f*ght countless enemies, and
yet in the end, he was terrified.

He was terrified of her...

To lie beside her,

to be comforted by her
as he wept,

to show her he was small,

for her to know that
and touch his cheek

and whisper words softly
into his ear.

All of that was a nightmare.

All he knew to do was run.

He took a deep breath
of the air,

tasting the salt on his tongue,

and closed his eyes,

leaning into the spray as The
Merciful picked up speed

and sailed for the horizon.

He was alone,

""and all was well.""

Take this thing out of me.

Why?

So we can't ever
come back here again.

We f*cked up with Nora.

Let's go watch.

I thought you were gone.

It was raining so hard
and I got scared.

So I came up here.

Okay.

I don't think
I'm ready to come down.

Now what?

My name
is Nora Elizabeth Jamison-Durst.

I hereby indemnify
all individuals

for the procedure
that's about to occur.

Today is the day I'm leaving
to be with him.

I'm ready to go now."

world needed to feel better.

We were all in emotional distress.

Why do you think I joined
a f*cking cult?

You were a good husband Kevin,

but I think I'm supposed to stay broken.

It's free.

I need to fly to Australia.

The only reason you
even know where Kevin is,

is because he called me.

I'm Dr. Eden and that is Dr. Bekker.

We are sending people to the destination

the others went seven years ago.

Go home, Ms. Durst. This isn't for you.

How long before you move past it?

You lost your kids.

My kids are not dead.
They are just gone.

Then, you should go be with them.

This tells of a Police Chief
named Kevin,

who passed into the land
of the dead and spoke to them.

I don't think you're crazy, Grace.

You just got the wrong Kevin.

I gave up.

After the four miscarriages,

we tried IVF.

40 grand for three eggs.

We joked about how we were
gonna end up with triplets

and whether we should
make their names rhyme.

But none of them stuck.

Not the names, the eggs.

And that was that.

I gave up.

No baby for me.

And then five years went by

and we finally stopped
bullshitting about adoption,

and then it just...

happened. (CHUCKLES)

I was pregnant.

And he was...

perfect.

His name is Sam.

Six months later, I walk
into the Laundromat

and I strap him into his car seat.

And he was crying,

so I didn't kiss him.

I knew that once the car was
moving, he'd calm down.

And then he was gone.

So, I sit in the parking
lot and wait all day,

because he could come back, right?

They could all come back.

And if they did, it'd be on the exact
spot where they disappeared from.

So, my son, who doesn't
even know how to crawl,

I mean, he didn't.

It's been two years.
Maybe he's older now?

But he could just reappear
in a f*cking parking lot.

And if I'm not there,

if I'm not there when he comes back,

what happens?

Do you think he even remembers me?

I should stop.

That's what my husband said.

I need to give up, right?

(SNIFFLING)

Right?

Are you gonna say something?

You know there are two of those bitches
in white standing out front right now,

smoking their f*cking cigarettes?

They probably think your
patients are easy pickings.

If I asked them to tell me what to do,

they'd at least write it down for me.

Is that what I should do?

Tell me what to f*cking do.

I don't know.

You should see the other guy.

I take it your husband
told you we were here.

Which husband?

I heard you were with the
good Reverend Jamison.

He coming, too?

No.

He gave me something for you, though.

(CAR DOOR OPENS)

He says he's sorry he didn't
put you in his f*cking book.

Who torched it?

Your son.

Is he here?

He was.

Right now, he's off

A think about what?

We asked him to die.

Dr. Bekker and Dr. Eden.

Yeah, that's them.

They don't look like physicists to me.

What are physicists
supposed to look like?

I don't know. Shouldn't they be
wearing lab coats or something?

So, now what?

Now? Now we wait.

(SIGHS)

Kevin Sr.: So, I wake up,
my leg is k*ll me.

I got a tube in my arm,
another one up my dick,

Christopher Sunday is dead,

and I don't know where I am

or how the f*ck I got there.

And by there, I mean here.

So, I am discom-f*cking-bobulated.

I'm lost. I'm in f*cking agony.

I am in so much pain, I
can't f*cking see straight.

So, I got my hands on some
of the dog's pain pills.

I popped them and soon realized

they were a bit more powerful
than the human variety.

So, I passed out hard,

and when I wake up, I go outside,

and that is the first time I
lay eyes upon this young lady.

And she was drowning the police officer?

Mm-hmm.

Whose name is Kevin.

Correct.

It was a horrible mistake,

and I will be taking
responsibility for what I've done.

I'm not sure she understands.

Laurie: I understand.

You want to drown Kevin

so that he can go to this place
where the dead people are.

And while he's there, he's going to learn
a song from one of the dead people

and he's gonna bring
that song back to you

so you can sing it and stop the biblical
flood that's gonna happen tomorrow.

That about covers it.

And... and you've told all this to Kevin

and he's actually considering it.

Yeah.

He got one of Grace's horses,

headed out, said he'd
be back by sundown.

And you think that Evie...

that she's in this place, too?

Why wouldn't she be?

Well, so everybody wants something.
(CHUCKLES)

A brain, a heart, courage.

Kevin's in the Emerald City.

He's the one that's
gonna give it to you.

All right, Dorothy. Let's have it.

Tell us we're lunatics.

Yeah, it sounds crazy, but...

these are crazy times, huh?

So, when Kevin comes back,
you're not gonna jam us up?

No.

I'm not gonna jam you up.

You don't think he's coming back.

Well, it's a lot to... to put on someone,

asking for all that help.

I mean, if it were me, I
would just keep riding.

Get as far from this as possible.

But Kevin, he'll come back.

He always does.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

(KNOCKING CONTINUES)

G'day. Miss Playford?

No, sir.

And who might you be?

WOMAN'S VOICE: My name is
Maria Carmen Rodriguez.

Date of birth... 08-30-80.

This is a copy of this
morning's ""Las Noticias.""

This was my choice and mine alone.

I indemnify all others.

I'm of sound mind and body

and give consent to go...

- (SNORING)
- to go wherever they went.

Amen.

So, the two women in that
house, they recorded this?

One would assume.

Laurie: And we're also assuming
they're just gonna lead us

right to this device
they told you about?

You don't have to stay, Laurie.

You can go help Kevin.

Kevin's still at the airport.

Last I checked, all the
flights were grounded.

Well, Michael and John will
call me if they need me.

I'm happy to keep helping here.

You already helped by
finding me the address.

Oh, come on. You're not gonna let me
see this su1c1de machine for myself?

- It's not a su1c1de machine.
- It's not?

'Cause it sure seems like an incredibly
elegant way to k*ll yourself.

If I was gonna k*ll myself,
I'd just go scuba diving.

(CHUCKLES) What?

There are lots of ways to die
when you're scuba diving.

Your oxygen t*nk can break.

You can get a bubble in your
blood that gives you a stroke.

I know. I'm certified.

And Laurie Murphy was certified.

She had logged hundreds
of hours underwater,

but accidents happen.

What a senseless tragedy.

And then Jill and Tom and John

are standing there at the funeral,

and they're protected.

They'll never know that you twisted
the knob the wrong direction

because you wanted to.

And just like that, you were gone.

Clean, quiet certainty.

Fully explained.

Now, that's f*cking elegant.

(GRUNTS) Can I have a napkin, please?

Or if you're going for inelegant,

you could just do it like Matt here.

Know your cancer's back,

- tell no one...
- (SIGHS)

get no treatment,

pray for divine f*cking intervention.

- That's not fair.
- MATT: Yes, it is.

(EXHALES) I deserve that.

You... you don't wanna k*ll yourself.

- I know suicidal when I see it.
- (NORA SCOFFS)

You know suicidal when you see it?

Is that one of your psychic powers?

- I don't have psychic powers.
- Mm!

Oh, that's right. It's
John who's psychic.

Come on. You know how it works.

I don't, actually, because
I never got a reading.

(LAURIE SIGHS)

Why don't you do me?

What?

If I came to your house and
John took my handprint

and I sat down across
from him at the table

and I told him that I
wanted to talk to my kids,

what would you tell him to say
to me in his little earpiece?

We don't do departures.

Uh, do our parents.

They're dead.

Okay.

Um, well, I'd start on the Internet.

Look at social media, pictures,

um, personal details.

Like, your parents, how did they die?

In a fire when we were kids.

- I didn't know that.
- (MATT GRUNTS)

Nora: Oh, f*ck my parents.

I wanna talk to my kids.

I just told you, Nora.
We don't do departures.

You did departures when you and your pals
had life-size replicas made of my family

and then sat them down
at my kitchen table.

Come on.

Let me have it.

I can't, Nora. I'm sorry.

Why not?

Because we tried it,
and it doesn't work.

We had to stop after the third
time John was attacked.

Yeah. Look, death is easy.

People just want finality,
an end to their grief.

But with departures, there is no end.

And if we indicated otherwise

by just saying we were able to
communicate with those individuals,

it made their loved
ones very, very angry.

Because they didn't want closure.

I want f*cking closure.

He's still with Nora.

And where is Nora?

Uh, sorry. I can't disclose that.

You can't disclose it?

Look, when we all found
Nora in the hotel,

you said you were going to the
airport to be with Kevin.

And he wasn't there.

So, I called him

and he actually answered his phone.

He said he was here and
that we should come.

- So, why didn't you tell me?
- Because you don't believe in this.

- Hey, just calm down.
- Uh-uh. No.

She just shows up.

She won't even tell us how
she even knew we were here.

You wanna disclose how
you got that black eye?

I got it from Nora.

She hit you?

Thought you were supposed
to be helping her.

- I did help her.
- And now she's helping us, right?

That's right. That's right.

- (GASPS)
- Hey!

You wanna give us a hand?

(MATT GRUNTS)

Nora: What are those?

Steroids.

You got any painkillers?

- Headache?
- Nah. My uterus hurts.

Before you got to the hotel, I went
to a clinic and got my IUD taken out.

And they said it might be a little sore.

Told me to take a couple ibuprofen.
Jesus.

So, you're trying again.

- What?
- Nothing.

I just thought you would... might be done
after you gave Lily back to her mother.

I am done.

Still smoking, huh?

No, I quit.

I haven't had a cigarette since
John and I got together.

You stopped for him?

- No.
- (BOTH CHUCKLING)

I stopped for myself.

It's an incredibly
self-destructive habit.

That's what makes it so cool.

Laurie: My lighter?

Can I have it back, please?

You said you quit.

- I did.
- Then you don't need it.

Please give it back.

Like I did with Lily? (CHUCKLES)

- Give me the lighter, Nora.
- Come on, Nora.

- She said she doesn't need it.
- Give it to me!

Hey! Get off! Shit!

- Get off!
- Ow!

Oh, shit.

- Oh, God. Shit. Are you okay?
- They're leaving.

- What?
- They're leaving!

f*ck.

Go down.

- (ENGINE SPUTTERING)
- What the f*ck?

You steal this thing?

Said the man who just as*ault
an officer of the law.

Eh, he'll be fine. I had no choice.

His chief's in a tarp
under the g*dd*mn church.

He was heading right for it.

Where are you gonna take him?

(SIGHS)

Far enough away from
civilization to give us time.

You're just gonna leave him?

Well, here's the good news.

If this thing with Kevin doesn't
work, who gives a shit?

Officer Koalafart here

is gonna drown in the flood tomorrow
along with all the rest of us.

But if it does work, sweet Lorelei...

I will be honored to
spend my remaining days

locked away from the world I just saved.

(ENGINE STARTS)

It's getting late. I should
be getting dinner ready.

I'll be back before it's on the table.

(THUNDER RUMBLES)

Storm's coming.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

What you drinking?

Just some coffee.

Want some?

Ah, Jesus, that's good.

Remember when we went to coffee for
the first time, just you and me?

Of course I do.

I was hurting.

You reached across the table,

took my hands, and looked at me,

and I felt like I could've
told you anything.

But what I couldn't tell you...

I thought my daughter
might still be alive.

Erika never doubted it. She
took it in and moved on.

But me, I just... I just
couldn't believe it.

I should've told you.

(CHUCKLES)

Well, if you had, I wouldn't
have talked you into

helping people talk to
their dead relatives.

- (LAUGHS)
- Mm.

I thought I was helping you.

Should've taken the hint
when you shredded the money.

No, I shredded the money because
what we were doing wasn't real.

And this is.

Is it?

Do you want Kevin to ask Evie
why she left her family?

No.

I asked him to give her a message.

I want her to know that she was loved.

That's beautiful, John.

One of Grace's kids was
fostered out of a local tribe.

He loved boats.

When his family found out he died,

some of his cousins came
down here to leave a mark.

Grace told them to strip the church.

Took the wood from the church to
make a tombstone for his little boy,

a memorial.

Then that crazy old man got here

and became convinced it was
a part of his flood story.

I still believe him.

Because if I throw out his story,

that means I got to throw out mine, too.

Go ahead. Tell me I'm crazy.

Tell me we've gone too far.

Tell me, and we can go home right now

and forget all this.

Because I can still shred it.

I think you gotta see it through, John.

You're so close.

Matt: You're getting too close!

- They're gonna see you!
- Calm down.

I know what I'm doing.

Is your eye okay?

Yeah, it's fine.

I wasn't trying to hit you.

C'est la vie.

Did you hear about the guy
on the French submarine?

- What?
- The one who fired the nuke.

Apparently, he thought
there was some big egg

in a volcano in the
middle of the Pacific,

and he was convinced that this
giant seven-headed sea monster

was gonna hatch on the
14th and eat us all.

He said he got the
idea from Revelations.

That's ridiculous.

Revelations is not supposed
to be taken literally.

The seven-headed monster,
it's a metaphor.

Oh, so it's only literal
when it's not ridiculous?

- That's right.
- (LAUGHS)

You would know.

So, let's say this guy comes
and sits on your couch

and he says, ""Hey, Doc, I have
access to nuclear w*apon

and I need to destroy Godzilla.""

What do you even say
to someone like that?

- Don't miss.
- (PHONE BUZZING, CHIMING)

- Hello?
- Laurie, hey. It's Michael.

Hi.

- Are you at the airport?
- No.

We're at... it's a ranch
outside of Melbourne.

You're at a ranch?

- Wh-what...
- Kevin wasn't at the airport.

He was at this ranch.
He's here right now.

His dad found him.

He's with his dad?

- Okay. Um, what...
- You've got to come now, Laurie.

- 5 Pigeon Run Road.
- Okay.

Outside Makarra.

5 Pigeon Run Road.

- Is your dad there?
- Just get here as soon as you can.

- Are you okay?
- (BEEPS)

Hello?

What happened?

Kevin's at a ranch with his father.

That's good. Tomorrow's a big day.

We should all be with family.

♪ No, not one ♪

♪ No, not one ♪

Is this enough carrots?

That's plenty, love.

My husband,

he used to do all the cooking.

I spent years trying to get the
stew to taste exactly like his.

I even got it right once.

- Then I forgot what I did.
- (CHUCKLES)

Well, it smells delicious.

Was he a good husband?

Kevin.

He was a great husband.

He saved me.

But you divorced him.

Yeah. Well, I joined a cult.

You know, it was just one of
those things they made you do.

Oh.

I'm so sorry about your children.

Their shoes were missing.

Sorry?

When they found their bodies,

it was clear that they'd been
walking for quite some time,

but their shoes were missing.

They weren't here at the house,
they weren't with the kids.

I've covered the ground in
between a hundred times.

Looked through every pair donated to
charity inside a hundred kilometers.

When Kevin talks to them,

he's gonna ask them where
they put their shoes.

I need to go set the table.

Mind giving it a stir?

Sure.

Not much of a last supper.

Well, you certainly cleaned
your plate for not liking it.

No, the food is scrumptious.

I'm just saying not
much of a last supper

without our Jesus.

(YAWNS)

I think I'm gonna go
to lie down for a bit.

Wake me when he comes back.

Truth is, along with our
missing f*cking savior,

we also appear to be
short some apostles.

Our friend Matthew conspicuously absent.

Fortunately, I will
play the part of Peter.

(CHUCKLES)

You are already John.

What about you, kid?

You wanna be Simon, Bartholomew?

- Pass.
- Oh.

(CHUCKLES)

We all have to be somebody.

(SNIFFS) Somebody who was there
at Christ's last huzzah.

So, that would make me Mary Magdalene.

Mm, that would be Nora.

Also conspicuously absent.

You, Dr. Garvey, are one
apostle, and one apostle only.

Thomas. Doubting Thomas.

Mm.

When I first started hearing
voices back in Mapleton,

everyone around me told
me I was f*cking nuts.

Everyone.

Except you.

You were the one person who believed me.

You said those voices were really there.

(EXHALES)

The next thing I knew...

I was locked up in a f*cking
mental institution.

So you're wrong, Pop.

I'm not Thomas.

I'm Judas.

Doubting is easy

because doubting costs you nothing.

But Judas,

he was surrounded by
people going on and on

about how special Jesus was.

But he betrayed him anyway.

Because he was sure he
believed in something.

And he acted on it.

And then he k*ll himself.

What, sweetie?

Judas collected his 30 pieces of silvers

and he hung himself.

(HICCUPS)

- You all right?
- (HICCUPS)

If he... if he was so sure,
why'd he k*ll himself?

Well, Michael, I was not aware
of that part of the story.

I have no idea why he k*ll himself.

Did he leave a note?

Hey.

(KEVIN SR. GROANS)

Hey, are you...?

- Hey.
- (GROANS)

Are you all right?

Wh... Michael?

He's fine.

He's just sleeping.

I'm sorry.

It's true...

(GROANS)

I borrowed your pills.

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

Looks real.

Indeed, it does.

So, is this the part
where you call the DSD

and shut this operation down?

Do you remember when we were kids

after Mom and Dad died,

when everyone at the church
wouldn't take their eyes off us?

And they'd take us to
the movies and bowling

and Putt-Putt just to keep us busy?

Of course I do.

And this one time, they brought
us to a baseball game,

and I was too young to get the rules,

so I... I watched these people in
another section hitting a beach ball.

And the whole stadium
was getting into it.

And when the ball came
over to our seats,

you stood up and you just whacked it.

It was the first time I'd
seen you smile in forever.

But then the ball went into the aisle...

and this usher ran down and grabbed it

and he picked it up, and he just
squeezed the air out of it.

And then everyone started booing.

Not just the people in our section,

but the whole stadium, booing.

He just ruined it for all of them.

They just wanted to hit the ball.

Why would he wanna do that job?

Why would anyone?

Because if he doesn't...

that ball is gonna go onto the field...

and it would be f*cking chaos.

(CRYING)

(EXHALES)

(SNIFFLES)

You can take the van.

I don't need it anymore.

You wanna drive or should I?

Actually, I think I'm gonna
stay here for a while.

People should be with
their families, right?

Okay. (CHUCKLES)

Can you, uh, give this to Senior

and tell him I'm sorry I didn't
put him in my f*cking book?

And tell Kevin I'm sorry I did.

(SIGHS) Thank you.

Do you have to tell them I did this?

Give me a dollar.

- I only have hundreds.
- (CHUCKLES)

Give me, um... give me your cigarettes.

Congratulations, Nora Durst.

You are now officially my patient.

Same time next week?

You're on.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

Hi.

Hey.

John called you?

Michael did.

They said you were with Nora.

I was.

You help her find what
she was looking for?

I think so.

Where's everybody?

Inside, sleeping.

I drugged their food.

Jesus, Laurie.

Well, I wanted to talk to you.

Just the two of us.

I didn't think they
would let that happen.

You know what they want me to do?

You came here to talk me out of it?

No. I'm here to say good-bye.

Want a cigarette?

Yeah.

""Don't forget me.""

Is this the lighter Jill gave you?

I threw it in a sewer grate
and then went back for it.

Don't tell Jill that.

That's nothing.

I k*ll her hamster.

- You what?
- Yeah.

When you guys went down
to that mock UN thing,

didn't f*cking feed it.

I went up there about an
hour before you got home

and it was dead.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

Went to the neighbor's trash
and threw it in there.

Told you guys it ran away.

Well, rest in peace, Mr. Fuzzy.

Mr. Funny.

(LAUGHING) It was Mr. Funny.

That's right. It was Mr. f*cking Funny.

Remember that psychosomatic medical
conference thing I went to in Phoenix?

I lasted two hours.

And then I went to a spa
that cost $2,000 a night.

I hated our house.

- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

I mean, I didn't say anything because
it was your money that bought it.

Well, you should've said something.

- It was our house.
- You loved it.

I wanted you to be happy.

I was pregnant.

What?

I was pregnant.

16 weeks.

I don't, um... when?

Seven years ago tomorrow.

I was lying in the doctor's office,

staring at the ultrasound.

Looking right at it.

Then it was gone.

Why didn't you tell me?

We raised two beautiful kids.

It's the best thing we ever did.

The last best thing. (CHUCKLES)

Did you want another baby?

No.

Me neither.

I didn't tell you because
I didn't want to.

And then...

then I didn't have to.

Are you scared?

Scared of what?

Scared of them strapping you to a seesaw

and holding you under the
water until you drown.

The last time it happened,

where I went,

that was so...

it was real.

Maybe I was dead, but I
had never felt so alive.

No, I'm not scared.

Then I'm not scared either.

And it could work, so I could come back.

I really hope you do.

Will you stay?

I can't.

(SNIFFLES)

Uh, wait, wait, wait.

Got your lighter.

Oh, you can keep it.

I quit. (CHUCKLES)

Thanks.

Is Nora gone?

We're all gone.

Bye, Laurie.

Good-bye, Kevin.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(MOTOR REVS)

Far out as I can take you
with that storm rolling in.

If you're gonna go, you best go now.

Okay.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

(PHONE BUZZING)

- Hi, honey.
- Mom, thank God you answered.

I have a very important question.

- TOMMY: She doesn't know!
- Shut up! She's gonna remember.

Mom, do you remember that one
time when I was, like, five

and you found this
videotape at a garage sale

and I was obsessed with it?

Tommy: Tell her she's
making this up, Mom!

- It doesn't exist.
- It does exist! I remember it!

It had a mannequin that had this
hat that made it come to life

and there was a goose on a rainbow

and this creepy guy puppet

that, like, worked at
a department store.

""Today's Special.""

""Today's Special""! Yes! Oh, my God.

f*cking ""Today's Special."" Eat
it, you f*ck. f*ck, yes.

- (TOMMY CHUCKLES) Yeah, yeah, okay.
- I knew you'd remember.

You know how many times I had
to listen to that theme song?

(JILL LAUGHS)

I'm really sorry I put you through that.

It was just a phase. I forgive you.

So, hey, Tommy said Dad and
Nora went to Australia?

I tried calling them.
What's up with that?

Who knows?

What are you doing right now?
Where are you?

I'm just hanging out.

By yourself? On the anniversary?

Yeah.

It's, uh... it's kind of nice, actually.

Okay.

Well, enjoy your solitude.

- I love you, Mom.
- I love you, honey.

Tell Tommy I love him.

Mom loves you, you f*cking idiot.

(TOMMY LAUGHS) I love you, too, Mommy!

- Bye, kids.
- JILL: Bye. Love you.

- (THUNDER RUMBLES)
- MAN: Miss?

Now or never.

Reverend.

I brought a casserole.

Islands in the Pacific.

And early reports confirm
it was uninhabited.

The French government is
denying any responsibility...

God bless you, Reverend.
Thank you.

The person or persons
responsible for the launch

are not being made available
to the international community

despite overwhelming pressure
for answers.

- How is she?
- Still fighting.

We've all been praying for her.

Thank you.

Arturo, I need you
to fly me to Australia.

What?

A cargo plane with the donated food
for El Salvador

is sitting on the tarmac in Austin,
fueled up and ready to go.

I need to get to Melbourne immediately.
I'm asking you to fly me there.

But the expl*si*n...

They said all flights
have been grounded.

All nonessential flights.

Military and foreign aid are exempted.
And you, Arturo...

are not only a valued member
of our congregation,

but licensed
by an internationally recognized NGO.

Randy's available to copilot.

Reverend, I... I can't leave my mother.

That's $20,000.

It should be more than enough
to compensate you for your time

and get excellent care for your mother.

Something incredible is gonna happen
in the next few days

on the seven year anniversary,
but only if we go now, right now.

You... you said that we needed
to be in Miracle on the 14th.

We will be. We'll be back.

But there's a man, a very special man,
and he's supposed to be here with us,

but he's in Melbourne.

And because of this unexpected event,
he's stuck in Australia.

He's stranded.

God has placed an obstacle in our way,

but He wants us to overcome it.

He wants us to demonstrate our faith.

We need to go get this man
and bring him home.

- So, it's a rescue mission?
- Yes.

A rescue mission, exactly.

Okay.

Bless you.

All right, let's go.

I have some friends
meeting us on the tarmac.

- How many?
- Just the three of us.

Three wise men.

Hi, this is Kevin Garvey.
Leave a message.

Hello. It's me again.

I... I don't know if
you're getting my messages,

but I'm sure you're aware

there's been a nuclear incident
in the South Pacific,

but I've secured transportation.

I'm coming to get you, Kevin.

What are you doing here?

I'm getting on your plane.

You invited her?

The only reason you even know
where Kevin is is because he called me.

And we're immensely
grateful for that, Laurie.

- You're immensely grateful?
- Yes.

But with all due respect,

I'm not sure you entirely grasp
what's happening here.

Okay, three years ago,
my ex-husband experienced

severe delusions
and tried to k*ll himself.

And instead of acknowledging
his mental illness,

you turned it into f*cking scripture.

And when he found out about it,

he relapsed and ran
halfway around the world,

probably to get the f*ck away from you.

Is that what's happening here?
Am I grasping it, Matt?

Have you even talked to Kevin?

I left him a few messages.
He hasn't called me back yet.

What about Nora?

Nora?

Nora, your... Your sister?

She's not picking up the phone either.
But why would you know that?

Because you're too busy
chartering cargo planes to Australia.

Tell me, Matt,
does that seem reasonable to you?

Well, it must seem reasonable to you
since you're trying to get on it.

This is your fault,
you self-righteous shit!

Yeah, did you bring your whistle,
Laurie?

'Cause it sounds like you need
to blow off a little...

- f*ck you!
- Everybody calm down.

Look, this is my wife.

You want us to come, she comes, too.

We all want the same thing,

to make sure Kevin gets home safe.

Right?

Right.

Then let's get on the plane

and work this out
like civilized adults.

When we find Kevin,

you don't speak to him, okay?

I will talk to him. He didn't call you.

- He called me.
- And what exactly did he say?

What did he specifically say

that leads you to believe
he's delusional?

Did he see something or someone?

Did... did she tell you?

She said he was upset.

Upset about what, exactly?

Because I'm getting the feeling
we're not hearing the entire story.

No, the whole story, Matt,
is in your ridiculous book,

which somehow you convinced

my husband and my stepson
to keep from me.

Yeah, well, they kept it from you

'cause they knew
this would be your reaction.

Do you think it's ridiculous, John?

It doesn't matter what I think.

We'll know in the next four days,
right?

What happens in four days?

It's the seven year anniversary
of the departure.

So?

This is my plane, my mission!

And I will speak to Kevin

because I absolutely refuse
to believe he's psychotic.

I was married to Kevin for 15 years.

He used to look through
all of our cupboards

before he found the wine glasses,

he has a tattoo that's misspelled,
and he shits four times a day.

So, I refuse, Matt,

to believe that he's the g*dd*mn
second coming of Christ!!

_

__

_

What are those?

For my allergies.

Michael.

I need to know you're with me.

- Where else would I be?
- No, no, no, no.

I need to know you're with me,

that you'll help me
bring Kevin back to Miracle,

whatever it takes.

Maybe we should just ask him
what he wants to do.

We can't land in Melbourne.

What's happening?

The airport's shut down.
They're diverting us.

No, no. We're a relief mission.
We're authorized.

They don't care.

Where can we land?

Tasmania.

Tasmania?

Then how the hell
do we get to Melbourne?

Is this where I get tickets
for the ferry to Melbourne?

- Yes, sir.
- Thank God.

Our plane was forced to land
and we're stranded here.

No that Tasmania isn't lovely.

Three tickets, please.

Hey, f*ck you, Matt.

- Come on, man.
- Sorry.

Four tickets.

How long is the journey there?

11 hours.

Okay, okay.

11 hours. Not bad?

Unfortunately, tonight's ferry
is booked for a private group.

I'm afraid our first available
is the day after tomorrow.

No, no, that's too late. We need
to get to Melbourne immediately.

This, private group
must have a few extra seats.

They bought the boat, sir.

If you wanna get on,

I'm afraid you're gonna have
to take it up with them.

Are they putting a lion on that boat?

Sure looks like it.

Hi. Nice to see you girls.
Come in, come in.

I know I marked you off.

Right.

Hello. How are you today?

I'm 91 and I'm having a son.

I'm sorry?

I'm 91 and I'm having a son.

I think she wants you
to say something, Matt.

- What is it you want me to...
- Are you a member of our pride?

No, but if we could become members,
we're willing to pay.

No, no. No money allowed.

How come you didn't ask that guy
whether he's 91 and having a son?

Well, he's a friend of the captain.

Well, we're friends
of the captain, too.

Is that true?

No.

Listen, we have a friend
in Melbourne who's in trouble.

He needs our help. Your boat
is the only way we can get to him.

I'm appealing to your sense
of charity to let us on board.

No.

There's gonna be sex on this boat.

There's gonna be a lot of it.

Debased and sinful from port
to port, all without judgment.

Is that gonna be all right for you?

Absolutely. Yeah.

Well, then, why don't you tell me
the filthiest joke that you know?

- A panda goes into...
- No, no, no. Not you.

Him.

What's the difference
between a pimple and a priest?

A pimple waits until you're 12
to come on your face.

Righty-o, then.

The lady has free reign.

No law can govern the lioness.

And as for you fellas,
there's only one rule,

so learn it well.

When midnight comes,

let no man mention his name
lest that man become him.

Who's him?

Frasier.

Thank you.

There you go, now. Hello.

Terrorism? It was the French.

You think they're starting
a w*r with the English?

This is revenge for Agincourt?

Yes, you said that already.

But when will you...

no, no, I'm not at the airport.

If I was at the airport,
why would I be calling?

Hello?

Hello?

Flights are still grounded.

They refuse to sell tickets
over the phone.

I'm gonna go to the snack bar
to get some sandwiches.

You want some?

I'm not hungry.

There's still time.

Even if we can't get a flight,
we can take this ferry back

and Arturo can fly us home.

What?

We're not gonna make it back
to Miracle by the 14th, man.

Yes, we are.

Well, even if we find Kevin
right off the boat,

there's no guarantee
he's gonna come back with us.

I think we need to accept
that whatever's gonna happen

is gonna happen here.

No, no. We're bringing him home.
He has to be in Miracle.

You two should know that
better than anyone.

It was spared for a reason.
It's special.

You know, it... it cured my wife,
it gave me my son.

And my wife left me
and I lost my daughter.

It's got nothing to do
with where we live, man.

We just gotta let go
and see what happens.

We're not in control of this thing.

Yeah, well, that's 'cause
you gave control to Laurie.

Maybe if you'd given
a little more control to Mary,

she wouldn't have left.

Mary leaving was a test.

A test of my faith in that place
to see if I'd leave.

So, if you think I'm gonna be
in g*dd*mn Australia

- on the day of reckoning...
- Matt.

- What?
- You're bleeding.

It's fine.

I'm fine. It's fine. I'm fine.

He hit you?

What?

Your nose. God hit you.

No shame in it, mate.

I've seen God smite
many a man on this boat.

Ice bags in the infirmary
if you need one.

Sorry.

Are you asking if God
punched me in the face?

Indeed. The one true Lord... Yahweh.

Holy of holies.

Voice of the Olympics.

Red hat and a beard.
Likes the top deck.

But I'd steer clear if I were you.

Excuse me, sir.

Sir.

I'm sorry to bother you,

but are you telling people you're God?

""I am the one true God.""

I go by many names,
but Mr. Burton is fine.

I will not take a photo with you.

There was no big bang.
Just nothing, then light.

Yes, I created you.

No, I didn't create unicorns.

Eve was not made from Adam's rib.
It was his tibia.

I asked Abraham to k*ll Isaac
just to see if he'd do it.

Yes, evolution is real,

but it doesn't work
how you think it does.

I won the bronze medal for decathlon,

and the one you can't remember
is the hammer throw.

No, I had nothing to do
with the Crusades

""nor any type of genocide/holocaust.""

- Can you believe this guy?
- It was just a joke.

It's blasphemy, is what it is.

You know he's not God.
Why does it bother you?

Because he's saying he is. You know...

He didn't even talk to me.
He just handed me a card

and wandered off
like I was asking for an autograph.

I think you should tell Laurie
you're sick.

I'm not sick.

Yes, you are.

- You should tell her.
- Why would I do that?

My dad used to keep everything inside,

even with my mom.

All that time he was just pretending
he wasn't so angry.

Then he met Laurie
and she made him better.

No. He got better because of us,

because of the work we've been doing,
because of the book.

Laurie gave him psycho babble.
We gave him faith.

She doesn't believe
in the same thing we do,

but she wants to help Kevin.

I think she'd wanna help you, too,
if you just talk to her.

She... she's not part of this.

Matthew, John, Michael...
they were all disciples.

Maybe Laurie's one, too.

Hey, big boy. Wanna party?

Don't bother with those two.

Hey. How's your nose?

It's fine. It was nothing.

Do you mind if I speak
to Laurie alone for a minute?

Sure.

Of course.

I'll be inside with Michael.

That couple just asked me and John
to be part of a four-way.

How flattering.

Well, at least I learned
about this pride that we joined.

Yes. Apparently, back in the '70s,

there was a whole bunch
of these lionesses

in some wild animal park in California

that refused to mate
with any of the males there.

They just... they wouldn't have it.

But then something amazing happened

and the park rescued
this old fleabag of a lion

from a bankrupt Mexican circus.

He was ancient. He was, like,
in his 90s. It was a charity case.

And they brought him to the park
so he could live out his days in peace.

By the next morning,

he had screwed each
and every one of those lionesses

and ended up fathering 35 cubs.

The infamous Frasier.

Ooh, be careful. It's after midnight.

- No man may speak his name...
- Lest that man become him.

That lion that we saw
that they put on the boat

is one of his descendants, supposedly.

They're taking him around the world
to different zoos

so he can spread his seed.

Well, that is the foundation
of any respectable religion.

You know...

I think we should play it your way.

I'm sorry?

With... with Kevin.

I mean, letting him believe
that he's a messiah

might be our best chance
of earning his trust.

Let's be honest,
you have a better story.

My story is true.

- Come on, Matt.
- It's all true.

It's... it's based on fact.

I just wrote down
what Kevin experienced.

He experienced hallucinations.

He saw things that weren't there.

How do you know?
How do you know they weren't there?

Because Patti is dead!
Because Evie is dead!

- If you wrote a book every time...
- Evie?

Is that what he said
when he called you?

Did Kevin see Evie?

Please don't say anything.

John and Michael, they wouldn't...

just please, please, Matt.

What kind of person do you think I am?

I... I think you're a good person.

I think you're a good person, too.

Can I buy you a drink?

No. I'd just like a moment alone.

To pray.

Okay.

Well, we'll be at the bar.

If you can't find us,
just look for the orgy.

God speed.

Stop, stop!

Man overboard!

Man overboard!

I saw you.

I saw what you did.

There's a man in the water!

There's a man in the water!

I think he's jumped!

- Didn't he call?
- What are you doing, mate?

- Man, the boy is nuts.
- That's weird.

He jumped overboard, yeah.

What the hell were you thinking?!

I was trying to save a man's life!

You need to get the ship's manifest

and account for every passenger.

Whoever's not on the boat,
that's the man I saw go over.

There is no manifest, mate.

Your people bought out the whole boat.

My people?!

I'm not one of those lunatics.

Listen to me, there's
a dangerous man on board.

I can identify him.

He's wearing a red hat
and calling himself God!

You mean David Burton.

You know him?

That woman, she said he was
a friend of the captain.

I'd hardly call him a friend,
but I know him, sure.

We all do. He's a celebrity.

A celebrity?

He was a broadcaster
in the Sydney Games.

Had quite the touch.

He was a decathlete back in the '80s.
Medaled for Australia.

Yeah! Yeah, the bronze.



I read about it on the card he gave me

right after he washed
his hands of the Holocaust.

But what it fails to clarify

is how he went from being
a sports announcer to Yahweh.

It was after he died.

Yeah, what?

About three years back,
he went rock climbing with a mate

just outside Perth.

He fell 100 meters.

Broke his neck.

His mate dragged his body
into the cave

so the dingoes
wouldn't eat the corpse,

made his way back to civilization.

But when they got back there,

Burton was sitting
at the front of the cave,

not a scratch on him.

Said he felt absolutely fine
and that he was God.

People don't actually believe
this guy's God?

Some do, sure.
Most are just having a laugh.

I don't think he expected
so many people to be pestering him,

so he hands out those cards,
the frequently asked questions.

Spends most of his time in Tasmania.
He's got a little cabin down there.

He's quite a private sort of fella.

Spends a bit of time on the ferry
just to be amongst the people.

So he can m*rder them?

We don't have any other witnesses.

Nobody reported missing.

Well, those sex-crazed maniacs
wouldn't notice anyone missing!

Burton walks in here and confesses,

I'll be happy to contact
the authorities.

We dock in Melbourne in a few hours.

Until then, mate, I suggest
you go and find some dry clothes

and enjoy the ride.

You believe me, don't you?

Yeah.

Of course.

Like when I told you I didn't
molest my comatose wife?

Excuse me.

- What?
- Where's your list?

What?

When we got on the boat,
you had a list of your members.

- Where is it?
- I don't know. Somewhere.

One of your people
has gone in the water.

We need to find out who he is.

No, thanks.

You don't care
that somebody's been k*ll?

No, not really.

Of course not. Why would you?

All you care about
is f*cking each other and Frasier!

- What?
- You spoke his name.

He spoke his name!

He spoke his name!

He spoke his name!

He spoke his name!

- Become him!
- Become him!

Become him!

- Become him!
- Become him! Become him!

- In darkest Tijuana...
- Become him!

At 91 years of age,
who, by the force of man,

was taken from his home.

Frasier!

Taken north across the border

where the lioness
awaits a worthy mate.

Who is the king that she awaits?

Frasier!

Become him!

What are you doing?

What are you doing?!

- No!
- 91 and still in his prime!

- No!
- 91 to father a pride!

Who will give his seed?

Frasier!

No! Please. Please, no!

No!

No, no, no, no!

No!

Hey!

You people are sick!

One of your people
is out there m*rder,

floating in the water,
and you're in here doing this!

You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

Hey! I saw you. I know what you did.

You think you can get away with this?

Don't ignore me! I'm talking to you.

Are you all right?

I heard what you said in there.

You're right. They're sick.

We're not all like them.

There's a plan.

When we dock, be sure you stay
on the boat until it's safe.

When we dock, stay on the boat.

Jesus, Matt. You look terrible.

I'm fine. I just need to speak
to Michael and John.

- About what?
- Please, Laurie.

It's in your best interest
if you're not involved.

You know, whatever you got
to say to us, you can say to her.

No one seems to care
that I just witnessed a m*rder.

The man who perpetrated
it just as*ault me.

He what?

He hit me with impunity
and he needs to be dealt with.

Dealt with how?

We need to compel him
to confess to what he did.

""Be not deceived.""

God shall not be mocked.

""For whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap.""

No, we're not reaping anyone, man.

You used to burn men's houses down

for pretending to be
things they're not.

What happened to you, John?
What happened to your wrath?

He found peace.

He thinks his daughter's still alive.

That's not peace.

What?

Nothing.

What?

Kevin told her he saw Evangeline.

Here.

In Australia.

Is that true?

It... it wasn't her.

What he saw was... was...

it was a manifestation of...

it was... she wasn't real.

And if I told you, you would've...

I didn't want to hurt you.

I understand.

I wouldn't have told me either.

I understand, too.

She was protecting you.

That's what we're supposed
to do for each other. I'm sorry.

It's been a long day.
I haven't had any sleep.

We all need
to get some rest before we dock.

They've offered me a bed to lie down
in in the infirmary.

I... I think I'll take them up on it.

This is a distraction.

We need to focus on Kevin now.

Where's my book?

I threw it overboard.

It was just getting good.

You know how it ends.

What makes you say that?

Because you know everything.

You're being sarcastic.

No. I was just wondering

why I haven't been struck down
by lightning yet.

Why don't you,
transform those ropes into serpents

and free yourself?

I don't need to do that.

You're going to untie me
once you get what you want.

And what is it I want?

My attention.

I already have your attention.

No.

Not yet.

Not yet?

Well, you're finally talking to me.

Shh.

You're agitating him.

Admit what you did.

I've done lots of things.

You threw that man overboard.

Okay.

- Okay?
- Sure.

Say it.

I threw that man overboard.

You'll tell the captain
and the authorities?

No.

Why not?

Because I'm the authority.

Right, you're the authority
on everything...

creation, Isaac and Abraham,
the decathlon.

And yet you only won the bronze.

Well, that was before.

Of course.

Because you weren't always God.

You had to die
in a rock climbing accident

and come back to life
just like your son Jesus,

who, strangely, doesn't seem
to get a mention here

on your little card.

He wasn't my son.

You're denying paternity?

Mary's word versus mine.

And yet you still see fit
to steal his story for yourself.

He was the one who died
and rose again.

No. He rotted in the cave.

What?

Jesus had an identical twin brother.

That's who everyone saw
a few days later.

Thus, the confusion.

So, you take no responsibility
for your only son...

giving his life
for the sins of mankind?

Seems a lot to ask somebody.

Then what do you
take responsibility for?

Dinosaurs? The Black Plague?

Mount Everest? The Mona Lisa?

- The sudden departure?
- Yeah, that was me.

The sudden departure was you?

Why?

Because I could.

You're gonna have
to do better than that.

No, I don't.

- You do.
- Why?

- Because there has to be a reason.
- Why?

Everything in my life
I've done for a reason.

- Why?
- To help people. To... to guide them.

To ease their suffering
even though I suffered myself.

I sacrificed my happiness.

- I let my family abandon me.
- Why?

For you!

Everything you've done

you've done
because you thought I was watching.

Because you thought I was judging.

But I wasn't. I'm not.

You've never done anything for me.

You did it for yourself.

Is that why you're k*ll me?

When I was a boy, I was sick.

And I prayed to you to save me.
And you did.

Why is it back?

I can save you again.

No, you can't.

Untie me.

Ta-da.

You're saved.

Ladies and gents,
we'll be docking in Melbourne shortly.

Please dispose all rubbish

and collect your personal belongings
before you disembark.

Thank you for sailing with us.
We do hope you enjoyed the voyage.

There you are.

Fishing boat found a body.

Matches your description.

I've notified the police.

They'll be taking Burton
into custody when we dock.

They'd like you to go down
to the station and make a statement,

assuming you don't have
any pressing business in Melbourne.

No, I don't.

Hey. Did you get some rest?

Yeah, I did.

Thank you all for coming.

I'm glad you're here.

Are you okay?

Actually, Laurie...

I'm dying.

What?

David Burton, you are under arrest!

Out of the way! Out of the way!

- All of you!
- Stay clear!

Hey, this way, David!

Stay behind the barrier!

Aah!

That's the guy
I was telling you about."

are writing a gospel about me.

We can't just be going through
all of this for nothing.

You're going through this
because your daughter died.

I'm supposed to
believe she's gone

just because they say
her dental records match?

Evie did it before.
Maybe she did it again.

Hello?

Is this Nora Durst?

Yes.

Would you like
to see your children again?

They could build a device,
blast it with radiation,

- and it would go.
- Go? Where?

Wherever they went.

I saw a mother
who had lost her child.

And I gave her back.

Let's have a baby.

I just k*ll a man,
a police chief named Kevin,

because I thought
he'd come back.

I've gone a bit crazy,
haven't I?

No, Grace. You just got
the wrong Kevin.

Hello, Miss Durst?

Someone is standing by
to meet you in Melbourne.

Can you be there
with $20,000 in cash?

Yes, I can do that.

I need to go to Australia.

Can I come with you?

Final boarding call
for flight 87...

Final boarding call
for flight 87.

You two together?

Yes, we are.

Australia, huh?
Long trip.

Yes, it is.
I have Global Entry.

Where's the pre-check line?

It is right over there, ma'am.
Leave your shoes on.

No need to take your laptop out.

Oh, is it all right
if I go with her?

I'm a cop, so...

Do you have Global Entry?

- No.
- Then you can't go with her.

I'll just see you
on the other side, okay?

Sir?

Yeah...

- This way, please.
- Single file.

Arms up, please.

- Your watch.
- Oh, shit. Sorry.

Just walk on down,
come back through.

- Enjoy your flight.
- Thank you.

- Come on. Hey, give it back!
- You can't take it, no.

- Look, no, no... no, you
can't take it. Sir.

- It's my suit. No, look.
- Is there a problem, sir?

It's not on the list
of restricted items.

Okay, look, there's gonna
be a nuclear event

and I'm entitled to protect
myself from fallout.

Okay?
I'm missing my flight!

I need to get to Antarctica!

I need to get to Antarctica!

Another one bites the dust.

- Hey!
- Hi.

Everything go okay?

Yeah, absolutely.

- You?
- Great.

What are you smuggling?

Sorry?

You either didn't wanna wait in line
with me for an extra five minutes

or you're smuggling something.

So, what is it?

Heroin?

I have $20,000 in cash
strapped to my body.

- Lock the door.
- What are you doing?

I borrowed your duct tape.

They would've seen it if I
walked through the scanner.

Sorry.

Why?

It's illegal to travel out of the
country with more than 10 grand.

Why didn't you
just give me half?

Huh.

Help me get the tape off?

Ooh!

Ooh.

You hiding anything else
you wanna tell me about?

Maybe.

- How many?
- 119.

- Jesus.
- They made these testimonials.

They're standing there
holding a newspaper

like a hostage video.

They... they gave their name,
so I looked them up

just to see if any of them
were still around

after they supposedly
got into this thing.

The... the thing that
zaps them with the radiation?

Yes, honey, the thing that
zaps them with the radiation.

And were they?

- Still there?
- No.

Every single one of them
is unaccounted for.

- Where'd they go?
- Nowhere.

Well, I mean,
they have to go somewhere.

- Not if they're being cremated.

Ladies and gentlemen,

the seat belt sign
is now turned off

and you are free
to move about the cabin.

So, it's a sting operation.

You give them the money,
they show you the thing,

you see that it torches
people, then you bust them.

Right.

But you don't have any
jurisdiction in Australia.

That is technically true.

The DSD didn't send you.

So, you've gone rogue?

The DSD has their hands full
with the coming apocalypse.

These assholes
invited me personally,

so I can take them down myself.

They didn't know you were
a fraud investigator?

No, they knew.

They knew pretty much
everything, actually.

Well, then they know about me.

I'm sure they do.

And they still think you're
gonna get into this thing?

And what if they ask why I
came down here with you?

I'll say

that you've come to see me off

because we're in a toxic
codependent relationship

and we've both come to realize that
we're better off apart than together.

You gonna look your dad up?

- Look him up?
- Yeah.

I thought that's why you
wanted to come down here.

No, I came down here
to be with you.

Yeah, but if he's close by...

Honey, I don't know where he is.

And if he wanted me to know,
he would've f*cking told me.

Gotcha.

You brought your book.

It's not my book.
It's Matt's.

- But it's about you.
- Uh-huh.

Are you finally gonna read it?

- I already did.
- Really? When?

On the plane
when you were asleep.

- The whole thing?
- The whole thing.

""And so He left the bridge
and the hangman behind.""

And when He went into the woods,
he lifted the girl to His shoulder

""and she slept, she pressed
to Him and He to her.""

He capitalizes your Hs.

""Now the sun rose
and they had come to a well,

and He placed the girl
down upon its edge and...""

What?

If you read the whole thing,
what happens next?

He pushed her in.

Jesus.

Where does Matt
come up with this stuff?

Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit!

f*ck!
That's them.

- Yes?
- Is this Nora?

Yes, it is.
Who's this?

There's a bus stop across
the street from the hotel.

The 570 will arrive
in about 15 minutes.

Take it to the last stop.
Don't miss it.

- We won't wait. Good-bye, Miss Durst.
- What? I... I don't...

- That was them. I have to go.
- Where?

I don't know. They want
me to get on a bus.

- You want me to go with you?
- I'll be fine.

Are you gonna follow me, Kevin?

Yeah.

Look, I have to
do this alone, okay?

Okay.

Just take your nap.
I'll be safe.

Okay.

Dinner later?

Yeah, sure.

I'll be back soon.

God, f*ck.

G'day, Melbourne!

It's a beautiful Tuesday,
and I'm Pam Jolly.

And I'm Bruce Quartermain.

Today is October 9th,

and I have to say
I'm a bit groggy.

Oh, how was your night, Bruce?

Oh, I had a big night
last night.

- Did you go to the party?
- Well, I went to Melbourne's

Spring Fashion Ball last night.

- Tell us, tell us.
- Did you wear a costume?

Well, the theme this year
was under the sea...

- Good morning.
- Front desk.

Yeah, I can't turn off
my television.

- I can't see where it's plugged in.
- Yeah, so sorry about that.

It's powered from the wall.
Happens sometimes.

I can reset it from down here.
It'll just be a moment, Mr. Durst.

- Uh, it's Mr. Garvey.
- Oh, so sorry.

Would you like us
to add your name to the room

so you can have access
to all the guest amenities?

Yes, that would be great.
Thank you.

Well, I'm ashamed to say
that I did, Pam,

but at least I get to be having pancakes
with you here this morning, right?

- Do you like pancakes, Bruce?
- Well, now, who doesn't like pancakes?

Well, no one in their right
mind, that's what I say,

which is why we are having
a pancake cook-off today

right here in the studio.

Now, how are you with a spatula?

- You know, can you flip 'em?
- What kind of question is that?

Well, it's tricky.

And I sure hope no one
watching is named Kevin.

Why is that, Pam?

Well, apparently,
there's not one,

but two missing Kevins
in the Melbourne area.

Chief Inspector Kevin
Yarborough's police cruiser

was found abandoned
outside his home in Makarra.

Meanwhile, this man,
Kevin Garvey,

an American
holidaying down under,

was last seen wandering the road
near Kurripa nearly a month ago.

If you have any information
on the whereabouts

of either of these men,
please contact the police.

Right, let's get
to those pancakes!

- Are you ready, Georgie?
- Oh, yes, I am, Pam. Come on over.

Okay, now, tell us
about the batter.

Well, we've actually got
three batters, George.

The, um... the first one
is a plain buttermilk.

All right.
Mm, that's good.

Yeah, I like
the classic pancake myself.

- Because you're so boring!
- Aw, that's not all true.

The second one is banana.

- Oh, yum.
- That's definitely for me.

And the third one, of course,
is chocolate chip.

- Something different.
- Oh, Bruce, you'll have...

Can you hear me?

f*ck!

- Good morning.
- Front desk.

Yeah, I need you to turn my
television back on right now.

Oh, sorry, Mr. Durst.
I just reset it.

- Just give it a few minutes.
- ""G'Day Melbourne,"" is that show live?

- Sorry?
- Are they sh**ting it right now?

- Uh, yes, sir. I believe so.
- Where?

Taxi!

Do you know when the bus
is supposed to get here?

Uh, any minute now.

Excuse me, miss?

Are you a mother?

- Yes.
- Thank God!

I have a job interview
in that cafe.

My sitter didn't
show up this morning.

If I go in there with a baby,
then they're never gonna hire me.

Could you please watch her?

- Just for five minutes.
- I'm waiting for a bus.

Please!
I'll be in and out, I swear.

I really need this job.
Please.

- Um...
- I'm begging you.

Uh, okay.

- Okay.
- God bless you!

There we go.

Thank you.

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

Well, you're a good person,
taking a stranger's baby.

She could run off right now,
you'd never see her again.

Desperate times are these.

Just six days left, right?

Here's hoping.

Hey.

Oh.

Oh.

Um, excuse me,
when's the next bus?

Uh, should be another one
in about 45 minutes.

Um...

Please wait!
I'll be right back.

Wait!

Oh! I'm so sorry.

I have to go.

Discrimination is illegal.

- ♪ Serves you right to suffer... ♪
- Shit!

Wait! Hey!

Stop!

- Hey! Stop!
- ♪ Serves you right to suffer... ♪

Hey.

- Excuse me, excuse me.
- ♪ You can't keep from crying... ♪

Flip it like that.
Just like...

Oh!

Got a man down.
Pancake down... ah!

Just when I thought you were
getting the hang of it.

Doing my best here, Pam.

Hey!

Evie!

Evie?

What do you want?

- What?
- Just tell me what you f*cking want.

Why is this happening again?

'Cause I f*cking finished this.

So, what do you want?

Did Patti send you?

Who is Patti?

I saw you on my TV.

You were looking
right f*cking at me.

Everything right?

Yeah.

Yeah. I'm fine.

Is he bothering you, miss?

You could see her?

Just step back, mate.

You're real?

Do you know him?

I've never seen this
man before in my life.

That's bullshit.

I know her.
Her name is Evie Murphy.

You know me.

My name is Daniah Moabizzi.

Why are you doing this?

- Step back.
- Hey! Relax.

Do you hear me? Oi!

Get the f*ck off me, assh*le.

I know her!
I f*cking...

Miss Durst.

Yes?

Go on up.
They're waiting for you.

- ""Take On Me.""
- Ja. From?

- A-ha.
- A-ha!

Miss Durst.

I am so sorry.
I did not hear you come in.

I'm Dr. Eden.

And that is Dr. Bekker.

Hi.

Thank you for coming
all this way.

We are sorry about the building.

It's a little bit creepy, no?

- What'd she say?
- Oh, don't worry about her.

Um, let's go downstairs,
shall we?

Okay.

This is Bernard.

If you would not mind
removing your clothes,

Bernard will conduct
a brief medical examination.

We have a gown for you.

What kind
of medical examination?

It's very routine.

It's noninvasive.

And once you're done, Dr. Bekker and I,
we will just ask you a few questions

and then we can move on
to the next step.

If you're a doctor, why
aren't you doing the exam?

Oh, sadly, I'm a physicist.

But Bernard
is very professional.

I promise you're in good hands.

Okay.

Great! Well, we will
see you in a bit.

She was ready to go.

She was ready to go

and she wishes
she could've told you.

She was ready to go and she
wishes she could've told you,

but she just couldn't.

It was a stroke.

She was in a coma for three
months before he pulled the plug.

Tell him he set her free.

Three months
is a long time, man.

Uh-huh.

And she's grateful
that you set her free.

Thank you.

Thank you so much.

My pleasure.

No, but while I'm here,

could you kindly
try to contact my sister?

- I'll pay extra.
- No, no, no.

That's okay.

Uh, what was her name?

Margery Prentiss.

There's five Margery Prentisses.

I need a DOB.

What was her birthday?

March 17th.

Oh, shit.
She's a departure.

Abort.
Abort.

Sir, did your sister
disappear on October 14th?

Yes.

Why?

I'm so sorry, but I
can't make a connection

with those who departed.

They're in
a different space, man.

Wish I could
help you out, but...

I can't.
I'm sorry.

I'm gonna take this.

Give him a hug and tell him the
dead wife wants him to move on.

- Hey.
- Laurie, it's Kevin. Are you alone?

What?

Are you alone?
Is John with you?

He's... he's downstairs.

You okay?

I just saw Evie.

- What?
- Evie. Evangeline Murphy.

She's alive. She's in f*cking
Melbourne, Australia.

You're...
You're in Australia?

Yeah. Nora had
to come here for work.

It doesn't matter.

She's here.

She's here.
I talked to her, Laurie.

Okay.
Okay, Kevin.

I just...
I need you to slow down

and explain to me exactly
what you think you saw.

No, I don't think
I saw anything.

I had a f*cking
conversation with her.

She's... she's here.

She's... I need you to do that thing
that you do on your computer

with the... you know,
go on Facebook.

I need you to find her.

She's in Melbourne and she's
using a different name.

She's using, um,
Daniah Moabizzi.

Daniah Moabizzi.

I... I took a picture
on my phone.

I'm gonna send that to you, okay?
Hang on, hang on.

Daniah. Did you see her
at the Melbourne Library?

Why? Does she work there?

Did you get the picture?

Yeah, I got it.

It's her.

I know it's her.

Did you talk to Nora about this?

Nora's not here right now.

And why did you say
she was at the library?

Hey...

Kevin...

under no circumstances should
you approach Evie again, okay?

It might scare her off.

We just...
We need to figure out

what we're gonna do
about this, okay?

We need to...

Kevin?

Kevin?!

Excuse me.

Excuse me!

You know where
the public library is?

120/80. Optimal.

Almost done.

Just need to draw some blood.

Why?

Anemia, glucose, potassium,
heavy metals, and pregnancy.

Well, I'm definitely
not pregnant.

Oh, right.
Your IUD.

You'll need to have it removed
before you go through.

- We can refer you to a...
- How did you know I had an IUD?

It's in your medical records.

Just gonna affix some sensors
for an electrocardiogram.

Oh.

Would you mind lowering
your gown, please?

The event chamber of the device

requires an intense period
of confinement.

So we're gonna simulate that
now while we're monitoring you

just to see how well
you hold up.

It'll just be for a few minutes.

There's plenty of air in there.

I am gonna close the lid, but
you can get out at any time.

If you wanna take your money in
the box with you, that's fine.

Some folks worry that we're gonna run
off with it while they're inside.

No, I trust you.

Hi. Hey.

Uh, is Daniah working today?

Who?

Uh, Daniah or Daneeah.

- ""Danyah""?
- ""Danyah,"" yes.

I'm not sure. Is there something
I can do for you, sir?

Yeah, she was helping me
look for a book.

What book was it?

Um, uh, ""Assassins.""

""Assassins,"" I think.

The title is ""Assassins""?

No. If you call her,
she could probably help me.

- We don't have a book by that title. I'm sorry.
- No, I know that... I know.

But if you just get ahold of Daniah,
then I think she could help me.

So, if you just do that, that'd
be f*cking great, please.

Leonard?

Oh, uh, no. I...

He's being weird.

That so?

No! Um, I just...
I don't want any trouble.

- I was just...
- Fantastic.

Let's take a walk, mate.

I need to get a book
that I was looking...

You're leaving.

It's okay, Leonard.

You know this bloke, Danni?

Yes.

I know him.

Let's talk, Kevin.

I am Evie Murphy.

I have started a new life.

I am asking you not to tell
anyone that you have seen me.

Not my mother,
my father, my brother.

I just need you
to leave me alone.

John's my friend.
He thinks you're dead.

I have started a new life.

You don't have the right
to take that away from me.

Then you need to tell me
why you're doing this.

Because...

there is no family.

Then why are you still
using that accent?

- I have to go.
- No, no.

What the f*ck is going on?

What?

I have compassion for you

because you are ill.

I wanted to help.

She told me to tell you that
I was who you thought I was

and then you'd go away.

Who told you?

Mm-mm. No, no.



This one's on me.

Well, I hope you don't have
any expectations

because you took me
out to dinner, young lady.

I wouldn't dare.

- Who is it?
- Shit.

- It's Kevin.
- Call him back.

I, um...

I think I have to take this.
He's in Australia.

- He's where?
- Just give me... give me a minute.

- Kevin?
- What the f*ck did you do?

Okay. I just...
I need you to calm down

and just tell me what happened.

What happened is that
I went to see Evie

and she told me
that you f*cking called her.

- Where are you?
- The library.

With her?
Is she there?

Did you know about this?

Did you know
that she was down here?

Okay, Kevin,
I need you to listen to me.

I need you to... to leave and
go back to the hotel, okay?

Go back to Nora
and call me later, okay?

She told me that you said
that I was ill.

What the f*ck
does that mean, Laurie?!

Remember when you were seeing
Patti and I told you that...

I'm not seeing anybody.
She's right f*cking here!

You were seeing Patti
and I told you

that you never tell someone in
the midst of a psychotic break

that they are in the midst
of a psychotic break.

Remember?

You need to indulge that person's
delusion and find common ground.

Otherwise, it's very likely
that they will hurt themselves.

I don't...

I don't want you
to hurt yourself, Kevin.

Just leave Evie, okay?

Just leave her and go back
to the hotel, okay?

Or I hang up this phone
right now and I call John

and I tell him that you
just spoke to his daughter.

Laurie, you there?

Hello?

I need you to pull up
that photo you sent me.

What?

The photo that you took of Evie.

I need you to pull it up
on your phone.

Can you do that for me, please?

Okay, I did it.
What?

I want you to listen to me.

Okay? I need you to listen
to me very carefully.

You could've called anybody you
wanted when this happened,

but you called me...

because I think you knew
that I could help you.

I'm gonna give you
that help now.

This isn't real.

That girl is not Evie.

Look at the photo again.

I'm leaving now.

I don't understand
what's happening.

I think that you projected
Evie onto a stranger.

And I think
you chose Evie because...

you understood
why she did what she did.

Why she left her family.
Why she escaped.

I think a part of you
wants to escape, Kevin.

No, I... I don't
want to escape.

Then why are you in Australia?

You are chief of police.

You have responsibilities here.

It is less than a week away
from the seventh anniversary

and you just ran away
without telling anybody.

No, I... I came
to be with Nora.

She's the one
that needed to be here.

I... she's the one
that ran away.

Kevin, are you and Nora okay?

Ask John about the f*cking
book he wrote about me.

Welcome back.

Your heart is very calm.

What?

Your heart rate.

It's very even.

Most people panic
after a few minutes.

Oh, thanks.

Let's have a chat, shall we?

Okay.

Mr. Linn-Baker enjoyed
talking to you in St. Louis.

Where is
Mr. Linn-Baker?

He went through.

Through the machine?

- Yes.
- Is it here in this building?

No, it's not here.

I'm happy to answer

any other questions
you may have about the device,

technical or otherwise.

Why haven't you used it?

Everything I need is here.

What about you?

I don't like the odds.

Odds?

All we know for certain

is that we are sending people

to the exact same destination

the others went seven years ago.

The odds that this destination
has a sustainable environment

with a breathable atmosphere and ample
food supply are very, very low,

so it is more likely

there are 140 million corpses

floating out there
in space somewhere.

You make it sound so appealing.

Actually, several of our
colleagues did go through.

- Dr. Van Eeghen,
the man who...

The man who designed the device,

he was one of the first
people to use it.

Oh, yes. And if you see
him, tell him we said hello

and that Finland won
the World Cup.

What did she say?

Dr. Bekker is...

Dr. Bekker thinks you have no
intention of using the device.

Um, she believes
that you're curious,

but once the time comes,
you will get...

Uh, how do you say...

Cold feet.

I won't get cold feet.

Good.

So, do you want my money now?

No, not yet.

We have a question
for you first.

- Just one.
- You wanna know why I brought Kevin with me.

My boyfriend.

You know everything else
about me,

so I just figured
you'd be worried...

We know who Kevin is
and we're not worried.

Okay.

What's your question?

Two infant twins are born.

One of them will grow up
to cure cancer,

but only if
the other one dies now.

You don't have to
k*ll the baby yourself,

but you do have to nod
to make it happen.

Do you nod?

If I nod, how will
the baby be k*ll?

Will it suffer or is it gonna
be quick and painless?

Quick and painless.

- Are they mine, the twins?
- Irrelevant.

It's relevant if you want me to
answer your f*cking question.

They're not yours.

She was working for you.

Sorry?

The woman at the bus stop
who gave me her baby.

That was a test, right?

We have no idea
what you're talking about.

Mm, sure you don't.

Please just answer the question.

Kids die every day.

What's one more?

And I get to cure cancer?

Of course I nod.

That's it?

Yes, Miss Durst.

That's it.

So, how does this work?

You give me a name,
I go to a hotel room,

explain what Low Amplitude Denziger
Radiation is, and then what?

Do I come back here or what?

That won't be necessary.

What? Why?

I'm afraid we will not be
proceeding any further.

What?

What, did I answer
your stupid question wrong?!

Oh ho ho, I get it.
I get it!

You turn me down and then you want me
to beg you to take my money, right?

Keep your money.

No.

No.

Wait!

Stop!

Go home, Miss Durst.
This isn't for you.

George.
George Brevity.

This is Nora Durst
calling for him.

Yeah, I know!
I am a fraud investigator

and I need to talk to him because
I've uncovered a massive fraud.

Mm, well, then... well, then
give me his home number

because it's an emergency.

No, I...
I will not hol...

God damn it!

Hi.

Hi.

What happened to your head?

- Are you smoking?
- Yeah, you want one?

- What happened?
- They turned me down.

- Who?
- The people who invited me here.

They... they told me that I wouldn't
be proceeding any further.

- Did they take your money?
- No.

- I thought it was a scam.
- Yeah!

And they must've known that I knew it was
a scam and that's why they f*cking ran.

But I'm gonna find them.

I'm gonna find them and I'm
gonna f*cking destroy them.

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Kevin.

What's wrong?

You can tell me anything.

No, I can't.

Why not?

The last time
I told you everything,

I woke up handcuffed to a bed
and you were gone.

Kevin.

I didn't know how to handle
you talking to a dead person.

Oh, Jesus.
Is it happening again?

- I, uh... we need to call Laurie.
- What?

I told her I would come back
here and we would call her.

When did you talk to Laurie?

- I needed help.
- With what?

- I saw some... I thought that I saw someone.
- Okay.

- I needed to make sure...
- Who did you see?

That doesn't matter.

You won't tell me, but you'll tell Laurie?
Who else? Matt?

'Cause if you're having visions, he's
gonna wanna put it in your f*cking book.

It's not my f*cking book!

No? I think you like it.

I think you wanna be
Jesus Christ f*cking Superstar

because it makes you
feel important.

Like it?
I f*cking love it!

It's riveting!

I've read it f*cking cover
to f*cking cover!

There you go.

Book's gone.

We never have to talk about it
again, because that's what we do.

We don't f*cking talk
about anything!

What do you wanna talk about?

What do you wanna talk about?

Why didn't you stop me?

Stop you from what?

From giving her away... Lily.

I didn't stop you

because you decided you wanted
to do it, and you did it.

You never even asked me
what I wanted.

And if I had, Kevin,
what would you have said?

You were relieved.
Just say it!

And now you want a new baby.
Are you f*cking insane?

Are you afraid you're gonna
give that one away, too?

You can't have a kid,

because then you'd
have no excuse.

You couldn't be a victim anymore.
You'd have to be okay.

No one would feel sorry for you.

I do not want people
to feel sorry for me.

Well, then how long, Nora?

How long before
you move past it?

Move past what?

That you lost your kids.

I did not lose them!

My kids are not dead.
They are gone.

They are just gone.

Then you should go be with them.

- I need a taxi.
- No taxis, sir.

Why not?

The expl*si*n.

Yes, hi...

I'll be back.

Jesus.

I can't believe
you're actually here.

I saw you on the TV
in the window.

I turned to my friend, I said, ""Holy shit!
That's my boy.""

We called the local hotels...

and here you g*dd*mn are.

Hey there.

Son, that's Grace.

Is this real?

Of course it's f*cking real.

- Where are you going, anyway?
- Home.

You didn't see the news?

All flights grounded.

Are you alone here?

Yes.

Well, you're not alone anymore.

Come on.

The airport's shutdown.
They're diverting us.

How the hell
do we get to Melbourne?

Please. Let us on board.

We need to bring Kevin back
from Australia.

You spoke his name.

Your people bought out
the whole boat.

My people?
I'm not one of those lunatics!

What are you doing?

This is your fault.

What kind of person
do you think I am?

- Creation. Suffering...

Sacrifice.

The Sudden Departure?

Why? There has to be a reason.

No!"

Chief Kevin Garvey.

Garvey? Thought you went crazy.

That was my dad.

Will you please shut up?
No, no. I'm not gonna tell him.

Your dad's

Do you want to

What are they gonna tell me

That I'm cured.

The voices, they just went away?

No, sir. I just started doing

They tell you

I can sit around and cry

Pull over!

They'll come up.

- Please pull over.

You know how long ducks
can hold their breath?

No. - As long as it takes for
you to stop looking at 'em.

Then pull over and let's look.

Okay, let's look.

I think they're dead.

- No, they're not dead.
- But how do you know?

Ducks go down, ducks come up.

This is the natural order

- Yep.

There they are.

They're okay!

They're okay.

And there you have it, folks.

Oh, thank you.

You took it without permission.

It's really important to me.

Yeah, thank you.

Why did Travis
wanna k*ll the president?

Travis didn't wanna k*ll anyone.
He's not real.

- I don't get it.
- Travis is pretend. He's in the movie.

John is real, and that's
how he got the idea.

So, John k*ll the president
because he saw it in a movie?

He didn't k*ll the president.

He tried to k*ll the president.

Why?

Because he's crazy, Kevin.

But the president's okay, right?

- Yeah, buddy.
- The president's fine.

And there you have it, folks.

The president is just fine.

Yes, sir.

I'm looking for a friend...
Christopher Sunday.

Maybe you have
an address for him.

If he's a friend of yours,

why don't you have his address?

I misplaced it.

You need to talk to Sharon.

Okay.
Who's Sharon?

She's a liaison to the
indigenous community.

All due respect, friend,

I don't need a liaison.

I'm a member
of the indigenous community.

Sharon's over at the cultural
center on Borland Circuit.

Anything else?

Yeah.

I had my mail forwarded.

I heard how helpful
you were down here.

Kevin Garvey.

May I see some ID?

Unfortunately, I lost it.

But I can tell you
the return address.

One Matthew Jamison.
Miracle, Texas.

US of A.

If that's not enough,
I can tell you what's inside.

You know the best-selling
book of all time?

I reckon it's the Bible.

You reckon right, my friend.

And that there...

is the g*dd*mn sequel.

Oof.

f*cking assh*le.

Full of shit.
Jesus.

What?

f*ck!

Oh, hi, Noah.

Is your daddy home?

Let Mommy, honey.

Hello?

Uh, hello.

This is Frank Johnson
from the Episcopal council.

Can I speak
to Reverend Matt Jamison?

- Frank Johnson?
- Yes.

Are you sure this isn't the former
police chief of Mapleton, New York?

Because I know Matt
would wanna talk to him.

- Who is it?
- It's your buddy in Australia.

I'm taking Noah to the park.

You want me to come?

Not when you have
important work to do, Matt.

- Hello?
- - Mary seems pissed.

- What'd you do?
- I didn't do anything.

We're just
working through some...

We're fine.

How are things down under?

Well, Matt,

funny you should ask about how
things are going down here

because it seems like
you don't give a shit.

- What?
- I'm not in it, assh*le.

I'm sorry?

I'm not in it.

I spent hours talking you through
what I'm doing down here.

There's not a word
in your g*dd*mn book.

Well, the book is about
what's happening to your son.

You know,
if he were in Australia...

I don't want him in Australia.

I don't want him anywhere
f*cking near Australia!

Okay.

Since you clearly weren't listening
the first time I told you,

I am not a part
of Kevin Jr.'s story.

He's a part of mine.

He's the one who guided me here.

Why isn't that in your book?

Well, I'm sorry.

W-when did this happen?

When he was eight years old.

Yeah, well, children
don't feature prominently

in scripture.

W-what about
Abraham's kid?

- Isaac? He was 36.
- No, no.

When Abraham
tried to sacrifice him.

He was a grown man.
36 years old.

That makes
no f*cking sense at all.

Did you, uh... did you get
the money I sent you?

Yeah, I did.

Ha. What's it for?

Well, just to help you out.

Oh, really?

It's not so I'll keep
my mouth shut

and not tell my son
you're writing

an unauthorized
f*cking biography about him?

Kevin, telling him
would not be a good idea.

He needs to just
go through his life.

Knowing any of this would not
be in his best interests.

It would be
in your best interest

to pick up some scuba gear,

because if I fail down here,

you are gonna be under a f*ck
of a lot of water, shithead!

Okay. Best of luck
with that, Kevin.

Go f*ck yourself, Matt.

Hello.

Excuse me.
Is Sharon around?

She's in the crapper.

You can wait in her office.

Oh, great.
Thanks.

Do I know you, mate?

I sure hope not.

- Oh!
- Good afternoon.

You must be Sharon.
I'm Frank.

- Hello.
- Is that snake Papunya?

It is indeed.

- How'd you guess?
- Oh, I'd know Papunya anywhere.

They have a very precise style.

Actually, I painted it myself.

- You did not.
- I did.

Well, then you are
incredibly talented.

So, what brings you here, Frank?

I'm looking for a cleverman
named Christopher Sunday.

I was told you might have
an address for him.

Well, the name rings a bell,

but if you're making a
documentary, you'll have to go...

No, no, no.
Documentaries are boring.

I'm just seeking enlightenment.

I'm only interested in
his wisdom, his counsel,

nothing else.

I'd have to accompany you.

I wouldn't want it
any other way.

Let me see if I can get
that address for you.

Uh, is this your son?

My grandson, Ollie.

He wants to be an astronaut.

My son wanted to be
an anchorman on the news.

- Yeah? And did he?
- Nah. He's a cop.

A good one.

And your...
Your wife?

She passed.

Cancer.

- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

It was a long time ago.

Did you find him?

It seems that, um,
Chris lives in a...

community just a few...

I'd like you to hear my side.

""Appropriation of sacred
ceremonies without permission,""

theft of creation songs,

misrepresentation of identity.

""Under no circumstances should this man
be given access to tribal elders.""

Shame on you.

You've stolen from these people.

Really?
I've stolen?

Same way your government stole a
whole generation of their children?

We apologized for that!

Shame on you, Sharon.

I have lived among these people.

I am trying to f*cking
save these people.

Save them
from what?! Oi!

Christopher Sunday.

I'm sorry if I mispronounced.

Are you Christopher Sunday?

Chris.

Chris, it's a real honor
to meet you.

I am Kevin,
Totem of the Bush Snake.

I've come a long way
to find you.

You're scared.

I am, yes.

Of what?

I used to hear voices.

They started about five
minutes after it happened,

after people disappeared.

So they put me
in an institution.

And there I stayed arguing with
something nobody else could even see,

fighting it.

And then I stopped fighting.

And I started doing
what the voices told me.

The last thing they told me
was to leave,

to go to Australia.

It's a pretty big country
you got here.

A little specificity
would've been nice,

but I figured instructions
were forthcoming,

and I always wanted to
check out the Opera House,

so I flew to Sydney.

Bought a ticket for Verdi,
put on a nice suit,

and I'm on my way from the hotel

when this guy, this hippie
with a red headband...

walks right up to me and says,

""Do you wanna talk
to God?""

That's gotta be it, right?

So I said, ""f*ck, yeah,
I wanna talk to God.""

And he said, ""Then you've gotta
talk in God's tongue, mate.""

God's tongue, it turns out,

is an experimental,
high-end hallucinogen

this guys brews in his basement.

And I wake up two weeks later

in a hotel room in Perth

on the opposite f*cking coast.

There's a smoldering
mattress next to me

and a bunch of white dudes
lying around in w*r paint.

And I have no f*cking
memory how I got there

or what happened while I did.

Also, God did not talk to me.

And I'm thinking this is
a f*cking waste of time,

at best, a misguided detour...

when I notice the TV
in the hotel room is on.

And do you know what I saw
on that TV, Chris?

A chicken.

On October the 14th,

a town in the outback
lost its entire population.

A small town, only 14 people.

But all of them vanished,
even the animals.

Every living thing
in that town was gone

except for one thing...

An egg.

Two days later, it hatched

and they named him Tony.

At first,
nobody took him seriously.

But then rumors started.

Rumors that the chicken
could help people find

whatever they were looking for.

And this is the first
f*cking thing I hear

when I wake up from
a two-week acid trip?

It's got to be a f*cking sign.

So, I hop on the train

4,000 kilometers back
across the country,

and I go see Tony.

So, I give this guy my money,

guy puts the chicken
in front of me,

and says,
""What are you looking for?""

""Well, I don't know
what I'm looking for yet.

That's the point.
I need Tony to tell me.""

And the guy says,
""Doesn't work that way.

You've gotta give Tony
something to look for.""

So I said, ""Purpose!""

I want
some f*cking purpose.""

And that very minute,

Tony jumped up on my pack
and starts pecking.

He was pecking...

this.

When my kid was about
eight years old,

my wife gave him a tape
recorder for Christmas.

She died about a month later,

so he... he kept it
with him all the time.

All the time.

Well, that summer,
I took him on a road trip

to Niagara Falls.

And he just about
drove me nuts...

recording everything we said.

Excuse me.

I like listening to it.

This is the tape
that Tony pecked.

I didn't rewind it.

I put it in the player

and waited for one last voice
to tell me what to do.

You have to sing it.

- Oh, come on.
- It's for little kids.

You're a big kid now.

You have to or it won't stop.

It's gonna get in the car!

- We're pulled over.
- We're safe.

- Please, Daddy?
- Just sing it.

Okay.

You did it!

On the seventh-year anniversary
of the Sudden Departure,

I believe the rains will come,

and with them

a great flood.

I have to sing to make it stop.

You have to sing?

For the last two years,

I've been working my way
down the songline.

I don't have to tell you every
community has a different part,

so I've had to learn it
piece by piece...

Every sacred site,

every ceremony,

every word.

You want my song?

It's the last one.

The last one.

And it is my understanding

that you are the only man alive

who knows it.

My song is bring the rain,
not stopping.

Well, that's all subject
to interpretation.

You want to stop the flood?

I do.

Start there.

You got a deal.

Can you see the problem?

Yeah, your swamp cooler's
leaking like a f*ck.

Can you fix it, then?

- You got a pipe wrench
or some duct tape...

Ah, shit!

Oh, shit!

Don't believe a word
that woman says about me.

Remember, we've got a deal!

Oh!

I rolled the other way.
You saw me, right?

I... I tried to miss you.

- Chris, can you hear me?
- Settle down.

I'm just concerned that when we get to
the hospital, they're gonna separate us.

And Chris promised he'd teach me something.
Didn't you, Chris?

Chris, Chris, Chris,
nod if you can hear me.

- Otherwise, they're not gonna believe me.
- Sit!

Sit.

Friend, I am acting
in your best interest.

You are looking at
an initiated Yanmedjaran.

Show a little respect
for your f*cking elder.

Uh, I'm sorry I lost it.

You're gonna
leave me here? Ah!



f*ck me!

f*cking, f*cking,
f*ck, f*ck, f*ck!

I don't think this is the
way we're supposed to go.

Garvey men

don't follow a highlighter
on a g*dd*mn triptych, son.

But what if we get lost?

AAA wants you
to take the interstates

to get you to drive by
the AAA Howard Johnsons

and the AAA
giant balls of twine.

You want a real adventure,

you gotta chart your own course.

Hey!

Stop! Ah!

Hey! Stop!

Stop! Ah!

Man, what are you doing?

They didn't take me.

- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Slow down, slow down.

Let's just talk for a sec.

They didn't take me.

Buddy, they didn't take
most of us.

You're not alone, trust me.

But that was seven years ago.

Would you k*ll a baby

if it would cure cancer?

What?

Would you k*ll a baby

if it would cure cancer?

No.

That is exactly what I said.

Wait!

Whoa, shit!

Ah!

Please let there be water.

Please let there be
some g*dd*mn water.

f*cking alcoholic.

Jesus.

I know what you're trying to do,

but it's not gonna work!

You can't stop me, assh*le!

No!

No! No!

No!

No!

Please.

I don't think I'm getting up.

So...

I need to eat you.

I'm sorry.

Know that you gave your life...

for something greater
than yourself.

Oh!

Ah!

Come on!

Shit!

Help.

Oh, hey there.

Oh.

Oh, no.

f*ck!

Oh, oh!

Hello?

Anybody here?

Hello?

Will you accept a collect
international call from...

Kevin Garvey Sr.

All right, fine.

Do you know
what time it is here?

I don't care what time it is.
What day is it?

- What?
- What day is it?

How long since we last talked?

Uh, that was three weeks ago.

Oh, shit.

That's just, like,
eight days left.

Shit!

Well, I'm sorry
to hear that, Kevin.

Uh, I'm actually glad
you called.

Could you send a photocopy
of the book back to me?

- I... I gave the original...
- I threw it away.

- What?
- Doesn't matter.

Look, I... I need you to call
the Kurripa Hospital.

That's Kur-rip-pah.

Find out if there's a patient
there named Christopher Sunday.

Matt?

You threw it away?

My friend,
you've gotta move past

that dumb book of yours.

I don't know where I am,
but once I find out,

I'm gonna need your help
in getting to this hospital.

- Kevin.
- Yeah?

Go f*ck yourself.

- Hey there!
- Hello.

You're building a boat.

Uh-huh.

For the flood.

I need to get to
the hospital in Kurripa.

Any chance you guys could
give me a ride there?

Lady of the house will take better
care of you than the hospital.

No, I'm fine.

Anybody here know
Christopher Sunday?

Oh, yeah, sure.
We all know each other.

It's a tiny country.

I know Chris.

You're the fella
that landed on him.

He's dead.

He's dead?

Shit.

""Caleb's arthritis.""

You Caleb?

I'm in pain, buddy.

Mm.

Let him up.

Okay, let him up!

Hey.

What are you ladies up to?

Oh, come on.

Hello.

Hi.

Would you like some tea?

How's your arm?

Itches like hell.

We get a lot of brown
and tiger snakes out here.

I gave you antivenom for
both just to be safe.

Much obliged.

You looked through my photos.

I was hungry.
It was in the fridge.

What's your name?

Grace.

Nice to meet you.

- I'm Kev...
- I just k*ll a man.

Okay.

I'll turn myself in tomorrow.

The other ladies you saw,
they had nothing to do with it.

I'm hoping you'll consider leaving them
out of whatever you tell the police.

Are you all alone out here?

Yes.

Your family's gone?

Yes.

On the 14th?

It was the 15th here.

f*ck.
I keep forgetting that.

You were with them?

I was in town at the Big W.

The register girl vanished
right in front of me.

She was holding
my box of Weet-Bix.

Took it with her.

I knew what it was
the moment it happened.

The Rapture.

I finally made it home
the next night.

I already knew the chapel would be
empty before I stepped foot inside.

Their Bibles...

Liam's, Abigail's,

David's, Samantha's,

Jimmy's, Sam,

my husband, his Bible, too.

All in a nice, neat row.

And when I saw them
in that moment...

I felt so blessed...

because God showed me.

He gave me confirmation that
my family now sat by His side.

For two years,
I spread His word.

For two years, I endured...

and held true.

Then I received a phone call.

Remains had been found
on my property.

The remains of five children.

Just bones.

Bleached in the sun.

The phones were down.

They had no way of knowing
if I was ever coming home

or if I had simply vanished
like their father had.

So, they set out on foot...

across the flats...

alone.

I thought they had gone,
you see?

Gone with everyone else.

I never even considered
searching for them.

If I had...

I took the cross from the chapel

and brought it out there...

to mark the place
where they died.

The place where I found you.

This was in your hand.

A page written like scripture.

One I'd never seen
or heard of before.

It tells of a man,

a police chief named Kevin...

who drowned and passed
into the land of the dead

and spoke to them.

Who freed them from their pain

and rose again.

Just 20 kilometers from here...

there's a police chief
named Kevin.

What are the chances of that?

It had to be him.

So, I went to him, to Kevin,

and I asked for his help.

And when he refused,

I drowned him...

because I thought
he was testing me.

Because I thought
he'd come back.

And once I'd proven my faith,

he would have no choice but to
help me talk to my children

one last time.

So, I thought
you were sent by God.

Sent with a message just for me.

But you're not an angel.

There is no message.

And God doesn't care about me.

It's all just a story
I told myself.

It's just a stupid, silly story.

And I believed it because...

I've gotta be crazy, haven't I?

No, Grace.

I don't think
you're crazy at all.

You just got the wrong Kevin.

Kevin, what's wrong?

You can tell me anything.

No, I can't.

Just tell me exactly
what you think you saw.

I don't think I saw anything!
Hey!

I don't understand
what's happening.

- So it's a sting operation?
- Right.

I'm gonna find them
and I'm gonna destroy them.

Wait!

Is this real?

I didn't know how to handle
you talking to a dead person.

Oh, Jesus.
Is it happening again?"
03,2 ,Don't Be Ridiculous,https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?t=53339&sid=1766bf46b509d0b9c82260f033d36cec,"Nora: Did the missing person use
an aluminum-based deodorant?

Woman: The man didn't
shower for five years.

Hygiene was not a priority.

Nora: Did the missing person have visual
impairment or wear corrective lenses?

Woman: No. Uh, no, ma'am.
He had 20/20 vision.

He could see from the top of that
pillar all the way to the bridge.

Nora: Can you please describe your
relationship to the missing person?

He was my husband.

Your husband, what was he, uh,
doing up there on that pillar?

Is that on your
little questionnaire, too?

No. I was just curious.

- Guess.
- What?

Guess. What do you think
he was doing up there?

I think it was an elaborate
coping mechanism.

Coping mechanism for what?

For whatever pain he was suffering.

Honey, he wanted to suffer.

He settled for the pillar only after
we got arrested trying to crucify him.

I got one nail in before those
f*ck had me in cuffs.

For country, my ass.

But that pillar
did the trick just fine.

He stayed up there in the rain,

in the cold, in the burning sun.

And he ate and he peed
and he shit up there.

He never came down, never touched
another person, not even his own wife.

That man never wavered.

He proved himself to God,

and-- and last night
he got his reward.

- You saw him depart?
- Yes, ma'am.

He looked so calm and at peace.

And all of a sudden,
he just kind of faded out

like he was on a dimmer.

And, um-- and he was gone.

And it was beautiful.

So, you just happened to be
awake and looking right at him

at the exact moment
that he, uh, dimmed out?

I wasn't the only one who saw him.

Ask around.

She says there will be another
departure here on the 14th.

I mean, I didn't
actually see it happen,

but, uh, how else could he
get down from that thing?

And the man on the pillar was the first
to go because he was the highest up.

I don't-- I don't know
how else to explain it.

He just popped like a bubble.

Mm-hmm. His wife was a woman of God

and, uh-- and she spent all
morning with the preacher, so...

Thank God for the preacher.

Would you happen to know
the name of this preacher?

Hello?

It's open. Come in.

Are you okay?

I'm fine. Just a nosebleed.

I take it you're here to
yell at me about the book?

What book?

The one I gave Kevin.
He didn't tell you?

Oh, no, he told me.
I'm staying out of it.

So, you wanna tell me where
the man on the pillar is?

It's my understanding he departed.

I didn't witness it myself,
but that's what people saw.

People also saw you with his wife.

Sandy and I are friends.

She lost a husband. I offered comfort.

Matt, I can literally see the lie
wheel turning in your brain.

When did I ever lie to you?

When I was five,
I stood out on the street

while our house b*rned down
with our mom and dad inside

and you told me it didn't hurt
because they were already in heaven.

They are.

Where is he, Matt?

You know, that poor woman

lived across the bridge in that
horrible encampment for three years

just to be close to her husband.

And when they finally
allowed her back in,

she pitched her tent right
at the base of that pillar

and took care of him every single day,

even though he never acknowledged her,

never gave a word of thanks.

Her loyalty and devotion,

I've never seen anything like it.

Except when you did it for Mary.

I get it, Matt. She left.

My heart breaks for both of you,

but you making up this bullshit
story about some nutjob departing--

He had a heart attack.

He fell and he died,

and his wife brought him to the church

and asked me to give him
a Christian burial.

And she asked me to promise--
promise-- not to say anything,

but I didn't lie, Nora.

I did not lie.

He deserves a legacy.

Can't you give a man a little grace?

So, are you gonna dig
him up or should I?

Kevin: One's for dry cleaning,
one's for gym clothes,

and then the last one's
for everything else.

Nora: Honey, you don't need to justify
your desire to have three hampers.

It's not a desire, it's a need.

Well, maybe we should
get a fourth hamper

just in case one breaks.

You're jealous. That's okay.

It's hard to acknowledge my genius idea.

Boy, is it?

- Ready?
- Yep.

All right.

One King James Bible

wrapped in Saran Wrap.

One thermos.

Empty.

What?

If I told you this was a picture
of him and a k*ll whale,

- would you believe me?
- No, I would not.

Huh!

John: Good morning.

Taking over up there?

Just cleaning up.

Came by to pay my respects.

He was friends with Michael.

Hey, John, I read your book.

- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

Yeah, Kevin left it in the
bathroom and I picked it up,

and before I knew it,
20 minutes had flown by.

It's exciting.

Y'all have a nice day.

I didn't leave it in the bathroom.

If we can't have a sense of humor
about you being the Messiah,

we're gonna have a problem.

These are his personal effects.

I'm so sorry for your loss.

Me, too, me, too.
I'm sorry for your loss.

Well, I appreciate that
very much, sweetheart.

If you don't mind, I'm just gonna sit
here and smoke my coping mechanism.

She's just hurt.

Of course she is.

Man: You took him from his pillar.

Now he sits in heaven by Your side.

He departed from our world
to be rewarded in Yours.

- Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
- Excuse me. Hello.

Hi.

You know what happened to him?

- What really happened?
- Come on.

Have a good day. God bless.

God bless?

Who gives a shit if they wanna
believe that he lifted?

It's not true.

Well, in 10 days when
the world doesn't end,

they're all gonna go home

and they're gonna find
something else that's not true.

Till then, I need to keep things
nice and calm.

- I am nice and calm.
- Yeah. Hey.

You're the calmest and the
nicest person I know.

Hard part's over.

Just gonna crack this open, okay?

And you are free. Congratulations.

How's it feeling?

Can you wiggle your
fingers, make a fist?

Good as new. Thank you.

Miss Durst, I'm sorry if
this seems inappropriate,

but when you came in last
month to get the cast,

one of the orderlies,

he said he saw you in the
parking lot before you came in.

I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding,

but he said that he saw you

slam your car door
on your arm on purpose.

Now, why in God's name
would I do that?

Hello?

Man: Hi. Is this Nora Durst?

Yes. Who is this?

Is this a secure line?

Who is this?

It's Mark Linn-Baker.

- Who?
- Mark Linn-Baker.

I'm, uh, calling on behalf
of a third party

and they-- well,
they've asked me to ask you

would you like to see
your children again?

What?

Your children, Erin and Jeremy,

would you like to see them again?

I've got news for you, you shit.

Your third party
obviously doesn't know

that I'm a fraud investigator
for the DSD

and I'm gonna have this call traced

and I'm gonna find out
what exactly it is--

They know your kids' names, Nora.

I'm pretty sure they know what you do.

And they don't care.
You don't have to trace me.

I'm at the Crown Central in St. Louis.

Just ask for Mark Linn-Baker.

- St. Louis?
- Yes.

And I'm only gonna be here
for the next 24 hours,

so if you want to see your children,

you need to come and see me in person.

Nora?

Yeah?

This is real.

George Brevity. Hello.

Hey, George. It's Nora Durst.

Oh, hey, Nora. I just got your
paperwork on the Pillar Guy.

Extra credit for sending
photos of the corpse.

Oof! What, did he land on his head?

Oh, is that Durst?
Go and ask her, man.

Oh, hey. Ocko wants to
know if you ever found out

what he was doing up on
that thing for five years.

Suffering, apparently.
Hey, George, listen.

Tell me, how do I know
the name Mark Linn-Baker?

The ""Perfect Strangers"" guy?

Who?

The sitcom. Yeah, they were cousins.

- One of them was a foreign guy-- Yalki.
- Ocko: Balki.

George: Balki, right. Yeah.

Yeah, Mark Linn-Baker
was the other cousin.

He faked his departure.

Yeah, Balki and the two actresses
who played their wives

lifted on the 14th.

Mark felt left out and ran off
to Mexico for three years.

You know what he's doing now?

No. Why?

I think he's running a carrot
stick out of St. Louis.

No shit?

Will you authorize my travel?

Aw, jeez, Nora, I mean, we got
our hands full right now,

you know, with
the seven-year itch coming.

- Can't it wait?
- I need to go now, today.

I think this is really big.

All right.

Keep all your receipts, okay?

Okay.

- Thanks.
- All right, bye-bye.

She's going.

- Hey.
- Hey!

What are you doing home?

Uh, I just came home
to change a shirt.

Oh.

Sick of me already?

I have to go to St. Louis for work.

Just a couple of nights.

Oh.

I'm gonna miss you.

I'll miss you, too.

Oh, do you mind if I borrow this?

I need something to read on the plane.

Really?

You don't want me to take it?

No. Uh, no. Matt said
there's only one copy.

Maybe Matt should've gone to Kinko's.

Oh.

Are you-- you busting my balls?

Can the holy balls be busted?

I'd love for you to take it.

We're on the same page
about this, right?

- It's ridiculous?
- Yeah, it's ridiculous.

Mm. ""And she did kiss
the lips of Kevin.""

""And lo, it was good.""

Love you.

Try not to walk on too much
water when I'm gone, okay?

- I won't.
- Okay.

And I love you, too.

_

_

_

_

May I help you, ma'am?

Uh, this isn't letting me hit ""no.""

And are you traveling
with an infant today?

- No.
- Okay.

Hmm.

It must be a dead spot.
Just go ahead and click yes.

It doesn't matter. You're
only taking up one seat.

May I use another kiosk, please?

All right, a deluxe room, one king.

Just a reminder,
we are a nonsmoking hotel.

And you requested that a rental
car be dropped off for you

here at the hotel tomorrow morning?

- Yes, that's right.
- Great.

Is there anything else
that I can help you with?

Actually, I'm here to meet
with one of your guests.

Oh, of course. May I have
the guest's name, please?

Um, Mark Linn-Baker.

Mark: Who is it?

They just called from downstairs.
You know who it is.

It's Nora Durst.

Please, come on in.

Did you know they have a
tailor here on premises?

I bought this suit yesterday.

They just sent a guy up, measures me.

Two hours later, it's back.

I never had a suit
fit like this in my life.

It's very nice.

May I have your cell phone, please?

- What?
- Your phone.

I just need to make sure
you're not recording this.

I'm not.

Please?

Ugh, okay.

Hey! What-- what are you doing?!

Sorry. It's just hardware.

Ugh.

Everything that matters is
up there in the cloud, right?

Uh, please, have a seat.

Uh, sorry.

I took notes.

- I don't wanna mess up the science.
- Mm.

Okay.

There are a couple types
of radiation--

non-ionizing and ionizing.

Now, there are a couple types of that.

There's alpha, beta,
gamma, and neutron.

Neutron is rare.

You only find it near particle
accelerators or reactors.

And yet, trace amounts were catalogued

within the first 48 hours
following October 14th

at sites where departures occurred.

- You with me so far?
- Oh, absolutely.

All right, the guys
who discovered this,

they bring their findings
to Switzerland.

And the physicists, the best
physicists in the world,

they confirm those findings.

And they name it LADR--

Low Amplitude Denziger Radiation.

So, great. Big deal.

They found LADR at departure sites.

But it's a footprint.

A shadow.

You can't do anything with it
because it dissipated.

It's gone.

Well, what if they could make more?

If they could recreate it?

They could build a device

and whatever they put
inside that device,

they could blast it
with that radiation...

and it would go.

Go? Where?

Wherever they went.

The 2%.

So, they built it, this device?

- Yes, ma'am.
- Then why haven't I heard of it?

No one would let them conduct
beta testing on live subjects.

- You mean people?
- Right.

Because they were
blasting them with radiation?

Exactly.

So, they had to leave Switzerland.

The unit is mobile now.

They don't stay
in one place for too long.

That was smart of them.

Ah.

I know what you're thinking.

They made me go to a hotel in Phoenix.

I felt the same way you do right now

when I heard it the first time.

- Her name was Lauren.
- Uh-huh.

Where's Lauren now?

She went through.

- Through?
- Through.

So, what's the cost?

Well, it's different for everyone.

Uh, I think it's based on a
percentage of your overall net worth.

- I can tell you what I paid--
- Mark.

- Yeah?
- I don't know if you

are a part of this or a victim of it,

but if this is real, if they've
actually built this device,

they're not sending people
to some magical place

to be with their loved ones.

They're incinerating them.

They will call you on this

with a formal invitation
and instructions.

All you have to do is answer it.

And this is a digital record

of the people who have gone through.

119 testimonials.

They are not hapless suckers,

not victims.

Each and every one of them had
to pass an IQ test to qualify.

There's a Nobel laureate in there.

I have two degrees from Yale.

Are you married, Mark?

Not anymore. You?

I'm in a committed relationship.

Oh, well, then I guess

I am just wasting my breath, huh?

Yes, you are.

And I think you may be suicidal.

F-four series regulars.

Three go, one stays.

Me.

You know what the odds of that are?

One in 128,000.

What happened was arbitrary.

It was purposeless.

It wasn't my fault.

I didn't to anything to deserve this.

So, no, Nora,
I don't wanna k*ll myself.

I wanna take some f*cking control.

Come on.

Hey! I saw that.

That's not yours.

Thank you.

Hi.

Hi.

This is yours, right?

Who are you?

Nora?

Christine, hi.

Hi.

What are you doing here?

Uh, I'm in town on-- on business.

So...

It's great to see you.


Man over P.A.: Ladies and gentlemen,

welcome to Austin
International Airport

where the local time is about 4:35 PM.

If you're visiting Texas, we're
happy to have y'all with us.

And if you live here, welcome home.

What do you want me to do?!

Please insert your parking ticket.

Please insert your parking ticket.

Please insert your parking...

Woman's voice: Thank you.

Hi.

- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

So, Michael said
Tommy's party was fun.

Yeah, it was nice. You were missed.

See you got your cast off.

Oh, yeah. The day before yesterday.

You know I would've done it for you.

I didn't wanna waste your time.

How'd you break it?

I'm clumsy.

Did I ever tell you how the day
after October 14th I broke my leg?

There was a picture of me on
crutches in the newspaper

once they found out about my family.

The headline was ""Nora Cursed.""

Rhymes with Durst.

- Nora.
- Hmm?

How'd you break it?

I don't wanna lie to you.

Then don't.

I broke it to cover something up.

Show me.

It's the logo for the Wu-Tang band.

- I think you mean the Wu-Tang Clan.
- Right.

Big fan.

What were you covering up?

Um, my kids' names.

Um...

The artist did a beautiful job.
It was very tasteful.

Very understated.

And it didn't hurt, the needle.

It was-- it felt good.

But, um...

just as he was finishing up,

I played it out.

I thought for the rest of my life

people would come up to me
and they would say,

""Oh, what a nice tattoo.

Who are Erin and Jeremy?""

And I would say,
""They're my children.""

""I'm Nora cursed.

Ask me about my poor,
departed children.""

It's pathetic.

So, I pointed to the first
thing I saw on the wall--

it looked like a phoenix-- and I--

I told the guy to give
me that one instead.

Just cover it up, please,
like it never f*cking happened.

I was having a bad day.

I think I'm going crazy.

Mm-mm.

You are not going crazy, Nora.

How are you not
going crazy after Evie?

Evie died...

and I got to bury her.

I got to bury her.

I bought a trampoline.

Come on.

Ugh.

Evening, ma'am.

License and registration, please.

My boyfriend's the chief
of police in this town.

You think I can get off
with a warning, Officer?

Okay.

Consider yourself warned.

I just got off my shift.
Do you wanna go grab a drink?

Can I take a rain check? I just
got back from a business trip.

Business trip?

Christine called you?

Mm-hmm.

I didn't go to see her.

I was in St. Louis on business.

They live in Kentucky.

How'd you even know where to find her?

She's not hiding, Tom.

She's putting pictures of Lily

- on Instagram and Facebook.
- Her name's not Lily anymore.

Christine just wants to know
if she should be worried.

She came after me.

She filed for custody because she made
the single worst mistake of her life.

She wanted to f*ght me.
And did I f*ght back, Tom?

No.

No, I didn't.

I sat across from her
at the deposition,

and all I saw was a mother
who had lost her child.

And I gave her child back.

And now she doesn't know who I am.

So, no, Tom, nobody
has to worry about me.

Kevin adopted me when I was three.

I don't even remember that.

I grew up thinking he was my real dad.

Then, when I was 10,

he and my mom decided that I
should know about my real father,

my biological father.

I spent the next 10 years of my life

knocking on some
assh*le's f*cking door

who wanted nothing to do with me.

He had moved on. He had a new family.

So, I wish they wouldn't have told me,

because I was already
where I belonged.

Well, do you know what I wish?

I wish you'd never left her for me.

I didn't leave Lily for you, Nora.

I left her for my dad.

I didn't even know you existed.

Can I print a photo from this?

Which one do you wanna print?

This one, please.

- Jesus.
- How big can I make it?

You are a heartless bitch.

Hey! Hey! Hey, God damn you!

God damn you to hell!

You're home.

Uh...

I thought you were gone till tomorrow.

I tear it off every time.

I just do it to feel, uh...

I don't wanna die.

It's okay.

It is?

You don't need to explain, Kevin.

Hey, look.

I got a tattoo.

A couple hundred more
and I'll catch up with you.

Let's have a baby.

What?

I wanna have a baby with you.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Oh.

Hey.

Sorry.

Are you happy?

Yes.

I'm happy, too.

Let's not f*ck that up, okay?

I need to get that.

Yeah.

- Yes?
- Woman: Hello. Miss Durst?

Yes.

Thank you for answering the call.

Mark explained the opportunity
we're offering you?

Yes.

Someone is standing by to meet you

at the Crown Central
in Melbourne, Australia.

Can you be there by Tuesday
with $20,000 in cash?

- Yes, I can do that.
- Excellent.

We'll see you then.

- Who was that?
- Work.

I need to go to Australia.

Just for a couple of days.

Can I come with you?

Yeah.

Yeah.

I can't be sure just yet, Jean,

but with the seventh anniversary

of October 15th fast approaching,

we may see some hellfire
moving up from the south.

And off the Gold Coast, a
high-pressure system of locusts

and perhaps blood boiling out.

Where you off to, then?

Oh, uh, just closing up, Chief.

Nothing's happening tonight.

You a psychic, Gerry?

Sorry?

Are you, like, uh, clairvoyant?

Can you see into the future?

- Uh, no, chief.
- No?

It's just that you've concluded
that nothing's gonna happen tonight

because nothing has happened?

Yeah.

I-it's just, um,

Ginny's not feeling well, so...

Ginny?

Who's that?

You know who she is.

I honestly don't.

I mean, it can't be your wife
'cause haven't got a wife.

I mean, it--

shit, I know who you're talking about.

You're talking
about your dog, aren't ya?

Yep.

Yeah, well, I'm afraid little Ginny's

gonna have to wait for you
to come home tonight

because, uh, you're on duty.

Yes, Chief.

- Yep.
- Good.

Cruiser one's got
'roo brains all over it,

so give it a wash, will ya?

I'm gonna take yours.

This oughta be good.

Good evening.

G'day, sweetheart.

Ladies.

May I ask why you're
blocking my driveway?

Are you chief of police?

Indeed I am.

Is your name Kevin?

Indeed it is.

""And He looked at them
and raised His hand,

but they did not wave in response.

And so He clutched
the stone to His chest

and jumped into the water.""

I don't know what the f*ck
you're talking about.

I know who you are.

Well, I don't know who you are.

My name is Grace Playford

and I need your help.

Well, Grace, uh, I'm off duty,

so why don't you and your
girlfriends run along home

before I call Mr. Playford?

Will you come with us, please?
I can explain everything.

No, no, no, I don't want you
to explain f*cking anything.

I want you to get the f*ck
off my property and...

What the...?!

Jesus, Florence!

He wasn't coming.

What the f*ck?!

What's happening?

It's all right.

You're amongst friends.

We know who you are.

Let me go!

I don't know why
you're acting this way,

but if I have to prove
I know, then so be it.

It's him.

Let me go, you f*cking c**t!

I'll see you in two minutes.

Kevin: Stop it!

No!

f*ck off!

Grace, what if it's not him?

It's him.

But what if it's not?

Okay, let him up.

Okay, let him up!

Kevin?

Kevin?

Kevin?

Hey.

Kevin, you need to wake up now.

We know who you are.

Wake up.

Help me.

Help me get the ropes off.

Let's get him off.

Get him off!

Grace: We've gotta get him...

Come on!

You all right, Naomi?

Grace: Kevin, wake up.

Hey!

What are you ladies up to?"

were lost three years ago.

140 million people disappeared.

Two percent of the world's population.

The Guilty Remnant.

A year ago these people
didn't even exist.

Now there's almost 50 of them.
What do they want?

We are living reminders of what you try
so desperately to forget.

People went away
from everywhere except here.

This place is chosen.

Welcome to Miracle.

So, are you moving in?
I'm John. We're right next door.

Something bad is gonna happen... To you.

It's all bullshit, right?

- Don't open it till I'm gone, okay?
- Back by 11.

Evie didn't come home last night.

She was out with her friends and...

- they're gone, too.
- Gone?

- I've been seeing someone.
- Who?

Patti Levin. She ran the Guilty Remnant.

But she's dead.

What you were seeing is not real.

If you wanna get rid of her, I can help.

- How do we do this?
- You die.

Kevin, stop!

Goodbye, Patti.

Holy shit!

Whoa! Stop!

It's the three girls.

Pull back! Too many of them!

Why would she do this to us?

- Maybe she didn't.
- What?

Love you.

(g*n)

(GASPS)

- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

I live here now.

I k*ll you.

- Nope.
- I don't understand what's happening.

Me neither.

You're home.

WOMAN: Heaven and Earth will disappear,

but my words remain forever.

But no one knows the date
now when the end will be,

not even the angels.

No, nor even God's son.

Only the Father knows.

The world will be at ease...
banquets and parties and weddings,

just as it was in Noah's time before
the sudden coming of the flood.

People wouldn't believe
what was going to happen

until the flood actually arrived
and took them all away.

So shall my coming be.

Two men will be working
together in the fields

and one will be taken, the other left.

Two women will be going about
their household tasks.

One will be taken, the other left.

So be prepared, for you don't know
what day your Lord is coming.

He's departed. He's not... I don't

There's a height ordinance.
Nothing above 15 feet.

You gotta take it down.

That dude on the pillar's
over 15 feet, man!

KEVIN: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

The guy on the pillar
was grandfathered in.

- Hey, Chief.
- What's going on?

These gentlemen don't seem to wanna
deflate their little joke here.

All right, no, no. It
is not a joke, okay?

Mr. Gary Busey's coming back
from heaven on the 14th.

How is he gonna know where to land?

KEVIN: All right.

Here's what I'm gonna do.

I'm gonna let you keep Gary up there,

but you guys have to be my deputies.

You see anyone or anything
that seems remotely dangerous,

call me personally.

Nuts, man. f*cking nuts!

You never underestimate the spirit.

MAN: Yeah, man.

- That was smart.
- Yeah.

See what happens when you
make people feel important?

Should I be writing this down?

Listen, we're already over our number.

We're a few bodies short
down at the bridge.

You mind running down
there till role call?

- No, not at all.
- And we got dinner tonight. 6:00 sharp.

- Don't forget.
- 5:30 works a little better for me.

- Well, 6:00 works better for me.
- Oh, okay.

6:00 it is. You guys do remember
it's my birthday today, right?

- Get to the bridge.
- All right, Chief.

(BOTH LAUGH)

MATT OVER P.A.: The king
of Babylon had a dream,

and that dream was terrifying.

So Daniel comes. He cracks his knuckles.

""Okay, tell me what you've got.""

""I dreamed,"" says the king,

""of a great tree stretching
all the way to the heavens.

A tree that provides all
things to all people,

but then it was cut down, destroyed.""

Daniel nods. ""Ah.""

""You know what it
means?"" asked the king.

""You are the tree,"" says Daniel.

""I am?"" says the king.

""You are,"" answers Daniel.

""And you getting cut down
isn't the worst part either,

because once you are down,
you will lose your mind.

You will go mad, my king.

You will live amongst the wild animals

and eat grass like an ox.

""Forever?"" asked the king.

""No,"" says Daniel.

""Just for seven years.""

""Deuteronomy""... every seven
years, you must cancel all debts.

""Genesis""... seven years of famine begat.

""Ezekiel""... they shall burn
them with fire for seven years.

So, what will happen on October 14th

just a couple of weeks from now?

Probably nothing.

But if something were to happen,

it would happen here in
Jarden, Texas, in Miracle.

Because I get a feeling
in this place sometimes,

the same feeling I got when my
wife awoke from a three-year coma

the day I brought her here.

- Mary.
- (CHEERING)

The same feeling I had after
being told by countless doctors

that Mary could not bear a child.

- (APPLAUSE)
- But she bore one here.

- Noah's a little shy like his dad.
- (LAUGHTER)

My friends, I've got that feeling again,

so if something does
happen on October 14th...

you've all come to the right place.

- MAN: Amen to that. Amen to that.
- Hallelujah.

CONGREGATION: Hallelujah!

MATT: I see a lot of new faces. Welcome.

If you wanna be baptized
here in Miracle,

just come on down tomorrow morning.

We'll be at the spring on
the east edge of town,

which the good Lord has seen
fit to replenish with water.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

You watching p*rn?

What?

Oh, when people are
watching p*rn, they shut...

Ah, never mind. Forget it.

Okay. (CHUCKLES)

You coming tonight? I
told Tommy 6:00 sharp.

Mm-hmm.

- Hey there, Chief.
- KEVIN: Hey.

Mm, what are you two talking about?

- Just Tom's party.
- Oh. Yeah, can't wait.

I'm sorry about the church.
I know we're over capacity.

It's just so many people wanna come.

Yeah, well, then look. Maybe you
should, um, stop advertising.

What's that?

The address for the
church is right on it.

No one loves handing out
flyers more than you do.

I swear I didn't do this.

You heard what I said in there.

No, I heard what you said in there,

and you said nothing's
gonna happen on the 14th

unless everything happens on the 14th.

I can't afford to have this
place explode again, all right?

Just tone it down.

Of course. You're right. Will do.

Will do?

If you're asking me to
tone it down, Kevin,

I'll tone it down.

Good.

Good.

Good.

Good.

Did he see it?

KEVIN: Okay, everybody. Settle down.

Listen, we are two weeks
out from the 14th,

and currently our estimates are low.

We are looking now at an influx

of anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000
pilgrims between then and now.

(ALL GROANING)

As of now, you're all approved

for permanent OT, effective immediately.

(ALL CHEERING)

NORA: Am I late?

No, you're right on time.

Agent Nora Durst from the DSD

is gonna tell us about
procedures moving forward.

So, everybody, listen up.

Thanks, Chief.

Can you guys hear me okay?

- OFFICERS: Yeah.
- Okay, great.

So, I know we went over this
a couple of months ago,

but there's been some confusion.

So, let's talk about the ""D"" word.

- (ALL GRUMBLING)
- Yes, I get it.

If a guy says his girlfriend
vanished into thin air,

there's a good chance she's
decomposing in his trunk.

But as frustrating as it is
to indulge the bullshit,

there is a process in place
that we all must go through.

If a suspect asks for a
lawyer, you get a lawyer.

If a suspects says
departure, you get me. Cool?

- (ALL AGREEING)
- MAN: Got ya.

Dismissed, assholes.

- (CHATTER)
- Walk you out, Agent Durst?

Absolutely, Chief Garvey. Thank you.

Tommy knows.

Kevin, there's no such
thing as a surprise party.

- Then why the hell are we doing it?
- Because it's fun to pretend.

Hey, help me out. Between the blades.

(MOANS) Oh, yeah. Ooh, higher.

(CHUCKLES) I'm gonna miss this cast.

Yet you never asked to sign it.

- Bye.
- Bye.

MAN: Hey, Chief.

A guy just came in and says
he needs to talk to you.

Is he Tinfoil Hat or a Kenneth?

Neither.

Knows you from New York.

Says you guys were hunting buddies.

Christ, it's good to see you.

- (CHUCKLING)
- Good to see you, too.

- Well, you remember me, right?
- Yeah.

- Dean.
- Of course. Dean, yeah.

What can I do for you?

Uh, you know, probably I...

I should hold back on the details

until I can provide you
with unassailable proof,

but if I'm being completely honest,

it's... it's a little out there.

Sure.

I tried to keep you out of this,

but I gotta regretfully inform you

that our prey...

previously unsophisticated
and easily k*ll...

- (g*n)
- (DOG YELPS)

has adapted.

So, Wyoming Senator Y. Woodrow Huffman...

the incumbent, mind you...

has a swanky fundraiser a week back.

Food's high-class, all right?

Crab cakes, Cornish game hens.

But this f*ck Huffman,

he asks me for a peanut butter sandwich.

He asked you for...

Yeah, I was undercover
on the catering staff.

Well, the senator was a guest
of honor, the man of the hour,

so f*cking A right, we
got him his sandwich.

You know, peanut butter.

Man, they loved that shit.

And he's the only one who touched
it, only one who bit it.

His saliva.

So, when you test it, you
know that it's uncorrupted.

Test it for what?

Canine DNA.

Now... now, I know what you're thinking.

All right? Why take on human form?

What do they want, right?
Today, it's the senator.

Tomorrow, it's the Secretary of,
you know, g*dd*mn Agriculture.

And then it's the president.

The leader of the free f*cking world.

And that, my friend, is how the
world ends two weeks from now.

That's how they get their
finger on the button.

Paw.

Sorry?

That's how they get their
paw on the... the button.

So, you... you don't believe me.

What you're thinking is happening...

isn't.

It's all in your head, man.

It's not real.

Look, Valdivia tells me

you're staying down by the trailer park.

So tomorrow, I'm gonna come by...

(BLOWING SOFTLY)

and we're gonna talk.

in any of this shit.

Yeah.

Well, you already paid, so you might
as well hear what I got, man.

(CHUCKLES) So, what?

You just, uh... you
look at my palm print?

You talk to my dead father?

Don't you think you should
light some candles, you know?

Maybe get out a Ouija
board or something?

Pat Benatar.

Now, how'd you know about that?

Look, I can't talk to your dad, man.

It's more like turning a radio

Why did he do it on my birthday?

(DOOR OPENS)

- (DOOR CLOSES)

I'm sorry to interrupt.

I'm gonna grab something upstairs.

- No problem. I'll see you later, Kev.

- Mm-hmm.

All right.

JOHN: Okay, now listen.

I know there's a part of you

that's hoping that he didn't
even know it was your birthday.

But there are some things you
need to know about him first.

(KNOCKS)

LAURIE: He believed
himself to be a failure.

- He believed himself to be a failure.
- He...

- LAURIE: He failed his family.
- JOHN: He failed his family.

He failed at his job.

He failed at being the man
that he wanted to be.

He was... he was sad.

He was always sad.

Didn't want anyone to know,

especially his kids.

He hid it from...

He hid it from Anne Marie and Billy

and you.

I'm so sorry,

but the truth is he was so broken

that he didn't even know
it was your birthday

when he took his life.

He was only thinking about one thing...

escaping.

So, that's what he did.

- He escaped.
- JOHN: And that's what he did.

- He escaped.
- Okay. You can hug him now.

They won't believe it unless it's harsh.

Jeez, now I know why I quit therapy.

(CHUCKLES)

What brings you by, Kev-o?

We got a problem.

We gotta keep it between you and me.

Okay.

Apparently, dogs are
taking on human form

and they are infiltrating the
highest levels of our government.

And... and where did you come by
this information, Chief Garvey?

A guy I used to know in
Mapleton a few years back.

Maybe we sh*t some dogs together.

You were in the GR.

I was coping.

So, this is my fault?

No, it's his fault 'cause
he's f*cking crazy.

Did you tell him he was crazy?

Maybe.

You never tell someone

who is experiencing a delusion of that
magnitude that they are delusional.

You told me I was delusional when I
told you I was talking to Patti.

And then you went and drank poison.

I'm better now.

Of course you are.

Just please talk to this guy?

I'm worried about him.

- You got it.
- (DOOR OPENS)

- Hey, man.
- How you doing, man?

You and Nora need any help
setting up Tommy's thing?

- KEVIN: Yeah, that'd be great.
- Yeah?

(WHIRRING)

How much is that?

It's 80 bucks.

- You just...?
- (WHIRRING)

She's good, isn't she?

She's the best.

of responsibility, Dad.

I could wish for world peace.

That's always a classic.

- Boo.
- No need to ask for a bigger family

since everybody seems to
be marrying each other.

(ALL CHUCKLING)

I always wanted a little
brother, by the way, dude.

Or I could... I could give it away.

Anyone need anything?

It's your wish, honey.

- NORA: Oh!
- (LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

- LAURIE: What?! What?!

TOMMY: Wishes do come true!

- LAURIE: Oh!
- (TOMMY LAUGHS)

Mary and me were in ""Huatemala.""

- ""Huatemala""?
- You don't pronounce the ""G,"" Thomas.

That's the first thing they
told the missionaries.

What they didn't tell us was
not to eat the cow brains.

I threw up for five days straight

and apparently hallucinated multiple
conversations with a burning bush.

- What did it say?
- Well, my Spanish wasn't so great.

Something along the lines
of, ""Please put me out.""

- Where were you, John?
- JOHN: Uh, well, let me see.

I was about a mile and a half that way.

Erika was in med school

and I was working at a liquor store.

- MATT: Uh-oh.
- Yeah.

Which didn't turn out to be so good.

Uh, your turn, Kev-o.

Oh, me at 25? Jesus.

I was... I was a cop. I worked
for my dad, the chief.

And, uh, this was long before he decided
to go off the grid and move to Australia.

But on my 25th birthday,

I was... I was driving
through an intersection...

and bam, the back of my
cruiser gets clipped.

I jump out of the car and
the airbags have gone off.

The woman who hit me, she's
shaken, but she's okay.

And I go over to her car.

There's a little two-year-old
boy in a car seat.

And he's just calm as can be.

He's just smiling at me.

Must've liked the uniform.

- Wait, that was Laurie?
- KEVIN: Yeah.

A year later, I married her,
adopted smiley over here.

- MICHAEL: Oh!

All because we both thought
we had the green light.

And it turned out that
the switcher was busted.

So, you know.

Well, divine intervention. (CHUCKLES)

What do you mean?

You know, like karma
or kismet, whatever.

You know?

(CHUCKLES) What?

Oh, nothing. I... I never
heard the story before.

It's lovely.

To being in the right
place at the right time.

- Yeah, right place, right time.
- JOHN: Right place, right time.

(CHATTER)

(JILL LAUGHS)

KEVIN: Sure you wanna
drive back to campus?

You could stay here with us tonight.

If I stay with you guys, it'll
just hurt Mom's feelings.

Then stay with her and John.

It's not like it's a far walk.

Yeah, but if I stay with her,

she'll just keep me up
all night apologizing.

So, this is the last time we're
ever gonna see each other, huh?

- What do you... what do you mean?
- Just the world is ending.

Oh, yeah. Well, right. (CHUCKLES)

How's Nora?

She's great.



She ever talk about Lily?

No.

Should I try and get her to?

What do I know?

- You still got your crown on.
- I know I do.

(ENGINE STARTS)

(SIGHS)

What were guys talking about out
on the porch? Your penises?

No, we were talking about what
we were doing when we were 25.

And I told the story about how when
Laurie crashed into the back of me.

- Oh, how romantic.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)

It's more romantic than when
we met in divorce court

and you told me f*ck my daughter.

That's not where we met.

We met at the Christmas dance

and you told me you
cheated on your wife.

- We gotta work on our story.
- Mm, yeah.

- (SCOFFS)
- Here, let me get that.

I got it.

- Come here.
- Thank you.

When do you get your cast off?

Um, day after tomorrow.

I was watching you from

Mm, yeah. He's yummy, isn't he?

Mm-hmm.

(SHOUTING STOPS)

(CHOIR SINGING)

The water's fine.

- (BARREL SPLASHES)
- It's a prank.

The water's safe. It's a stupid prank.

Trust me.

Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and savior?

What?

Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and savior?

Yes.

Then I baptize you, Kevin Garvey,

in the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit,

buried in the likeness of his death

and raised in the likeness
of his resurrection.

(CHOIR SINGING)

He is saved.

(PEOPLE CHEERING)

That didn't count.

Want me to put the air on, dry you out?

That's very funny.

Those kids with Evie on their shirts,

they were telling the truth
about what happened.

On the morning of October
15th, three years ago,

there was an unexpected gas
leak at the visitor center.

As the result of a cigarette being lit

by a member of the Guilty Remnant

who were occupying the center
at the time, the gas ignited

and the building and the people
inside were incinerated.

We pray for the families
of those that were lost.

And that's the story, Tommy.

But it's bullshit.

How'd you know the
water wasn't poisoned?

I just knew.

That's bullshit, too.

- (g*n)
- Oh, shit!

(TIRES SCREECH)

(sh**ting CONTINUES)

- (g*n CLICKING)
- f*ck!

(g*n)

Tommy!

- Tommy!
- (g*n)

You changed, you son of a bitch.

(g*n)

(PANTING)

I got him. (PANTING)

MAN ON BULLHORN: Folks,
this is a crime scene.

- (SIREN WAILING)
- Stay behind the yellow tape.

(CHATTER)

Let me bum one of those.

You have to talk to someone.

I gave Billy my statement.

No. You gotta talk to a shrink.

I was just doing my job. I'm fine.

I was just doing my job
when I k*ll someone.

It still f*cked me up. You gotta talk.
Talking helps.

You k*ll someone?

- (g*n)
- (SCREAMS)

(BODY THUDS)

Yeah.

A, um... a woman.

I had to.

She, um, you know... she had
armed security with her

and I... well, I k*ll them, too.

- (DOG BARKING)
- MAN: Hey, get away from there!

- (GROWLING)
- Stinkin' mutt!

It's a sandwich.

(CHUCKLES)

(TV PLAYING)

(DOOR CLOSES)

- Hey.
- Hi.

What's going on?

Can I tell him?

Mary's leaving.

She and Noah are going back to Mapleton.

What?

Well, when?

Now. Tonight.

We've got a flight out of Austin.

For how long?

Ever, Kevin.

We're going forever.

Uh, I don't... I don't understand.

Without Matt?

All of those years that
he took care of you?

He loves you.

(SIGHS)

Did you know that Matt won't
let me cross the city limits?

He thinks if I go over that bridge,

the magical spell that woke
me from my slumber will break

and I'll go back into a coma.

Listen, I know Matt
can get carried away,

but his heart's in the right place.

He's writing a book about you.

He what?

A book.

He thinks the New
Testament's getting old.

I've only read some of it,

but you figure fairly
prominently, Kevin.

- Did you know about this?
- No, I did not.

He got pretty excited when
you rose from the dead.

Where the f*ck is he?

Chief.

Can you give us a second, Michael?
I gotta talk to Matt.

He knows.

What do I know?

- Michael.
- He knows, Matt.

(SIGHS) Was it Mary?

Or whatever she said? She's
very upset right now.

- She just, um...
- Where's the book?

Can we just take a moment here?

You don't even know what
it is you're asking for.

Am I in it?

Yes.

Is it about my life?

Yes.

Just give it to me.

I can't. There's only one copy.

- Written by hand.
- I don't care how many copies there are.

'Cause whatever little story
you're making up is bullshit.

I'm not making anything up.
It's all true.

It all happened.

It's still happening.

(DOOR OPENS)

Brought y'all some supper.

What's going on?

Well, John, I'm glad you asked,

'cause what's going on is Matt and your
son are writing a gospel about me.

Oh.

""Oh""?

I sh*t you in the chest...

point-blank.

- (CHOIR SINGING)
- And you got up,

walked back into town,

didn't even go to the
hospital until the next day.

MATT: You tried to drown yourself

and an earthquake saved your life.

MICHAEL: You drank poison.

I buried you and you went
to the other place...

and came back.

You told them about the, uh, hotel?

It seemed important.

I'm not, um... (CHUCKLES)

I can die.

Of course you can.

Just not here.

What?

Here.

You can't die here in Miracle.

And that twisted bullshit, Matt,

is why your wife is taking
your son and leaving you.

""If you come to me, but
will not leave your family,

you cannot be my follower.""

Is that from your book?

- No, Kevin. That's Jesus.
- (SCOFFS)

- Well, I'm not f*cking Jesus.
- I'm not saying you are,

but, uh, the beard looks good on you.

- (GRUNTS)
- JOHN: Go get the book!

Where the f*ck is the book, Michael?

MATT: No, no, no! He's not ready.

- He'll destroy it!
- JOHN: No, he won't.

The f*ck I won't, John!

JOHN: All right, then so be it.

Him I understand, but you?
Come on, John.

Well, we can't just be
going through all of this

for nothing, man.

You're going through this
because your daughter died.

We don't know that!

We don't know that.

KEVIN: What?

I'm supposed to believe she's gone

just because they say her
dental records match?

- Y-yes.
- No.

No, man!

Evie did it before.

Maybe she did it again.

(DOOR OPENS)

I am trusting you with this, and I
know you'll do the right thing.

I haven't put your baptism in yet,

but it's pretty much up-to-date.

You're insane.

There's, um, glass in your hair.

Love is in the air.

Um, a little extra for your trouble.

Sarah, does the name Kevin
mean anything to you?

No.

I need to go to Australia. It's for work.

You mind if I borrow this?
I need something to read on the plane.

Holy shit.

How long?

Were you dead?

Eight hours.

Is she still with you?

Patti?

No. She's gone.

Then it worked.

Did you bury me?

My grandfather told me to.

He's gone, too.

I'm sorry.

Where you went... did he help you?

Yeah. He helped me a lot.

What was it like?

It was like a-- a hotel.

A hotel?

Yeah.

Did you see my sister there?

No.

I saw her somewhere else.

I've got to talk to your father.

Erika: How long you been up?

A while.

No coffee in the coffeepot.

What are you drinking?

[sniffs]

You going to church?

[scoffs]

Now why would I do that?

It's October 14th.

We go to remember.

I don't want to remember.

John, open it.

Open it or I will.

It's my birthday present and I'll open it when I'm ready.

Wait!

[paper ripping]

What-- what is it?

[chuckles]

She found it.

No, she didn't.

What?

The night she disappeared, I was here when you and Michael went to find her.

Chirped the whole time.

She must have caught another one and put it in the box.

And why would she do that?

Because you wouldn't let it go.

f*ck you, Erika.

[knocking on door]

John.

What happened?

The print on the car that Evie disappeared from...

Yeah?

You know how we told you you'd waste your time trying to match it with folks in town?

You weren't.

[pounding]

Hi.

Uh, hey.

Who are you?

I'm Laurie.

Garvey. Who are you?

I'm John. I live next door. Is Kevin home?

Uh, no, he's--

What's going on?

Oh, hey, Jill.

I'm looking for your dad.

Why? What's happening?

I just need to talk to him.

You know where he is?

No, but I'm sure he'll be back.

John: Are you?

What?

Sure he'll come back.

Oh, he's definitely coming back.

Print matched?

Indeed it did.

You want to talk, we should go inside.

No, we probably should talk somewhere neutral.

Okay.

Yeah, we'll give you a ride.

Everything's okay.

Stay here.

Everything's fine.

What are you doing with him?

Just listen to what he has to say.

I'll be all right. Stay here.

[engine starts]

Where have you been?

Your dad's.

I thought I told you not to go over there anymore.

I won't.

You going to church?

Go inside and get changed.

Jill.

You're gonna have to talk to me eventually.

What did you just say?

I said you're gonna have to talk to me.

I have to talk to you?

I know.

I know I deserve that and I know that you're angry.

No!

You don't know shit.

I know that your father's not doing very well right now.

He's got-- he's got some serious problems, Jill, and I'm sure you know that, too.

I came back here looking for your brother, okay?

And your father asked me to stay.

He asked for my help.

I'm not asking for anything.

Jill, this is your house and if you want me to, I will leave.

I will leave right now.

He said that we should stay.

[sighs]

[Lily crying]

[thumps]

Oh, sorry.

Okay.

All right. Okay, sit tight.

I'm gonna find that feeding tube and we'll get out of here, okay?

Bingo! Right where Matt said it was.

I'm just gonna change her real quick, okay?

Okay. Okay.

How about some music? You want some music?

Let's try this. Okay.

[music playing]

[crying louder]

I know. I don't like that, either.

Radio host: Did you lose someone?

Caller: Our little girl, Emily.

Radio host: How old was she?

Caller: 14 months.

She was talking real sentences.

Before any of our friends' kids.

I bragged about it.

Radio host: Well, that's what proud fathers do.

Can I ask what happened? Why your wife left?

Caller: I want to have another baby.

Radio host: And your wife?

Caller: She says it would hurt too much.

Now, I told her we could start over.

It's a new life.

It'll help us, you know, forget.

Radio host: You know what, Andy?

I'm gonna have to side with your wife on this one.

She's not ready.

That thing inside all of us, that mechanism that allows us to love, your wife's, it's broken.

And a new baby's not going to fix that.

But you know what can?

Jesus.

After all, he was the original Departure, right?

Fix that, Jesus.

Yeah, it's okay.

It's real.

Oh, God!

Oh, thank God.

[laughing]

Oh!

Are you all right?

I'm a little confused, but okay.

You have to take her back right now.

What?

Mary, listen.

You can't be out here. It's not-- you have to go back to town right now.

Okay, let's go, then.

No, I can't.

You have to take her back right now.

It's not safe out here. The baby.

The what?

You didn't tell her?

Nora: I thought you would want to.

I'm pregnant?

[both laugh]

Now, Mary, do you remember the night you woke up, we, um--

Had sex?

Yes.

Of course I remember.

Well, you waking up, that happened.

This baby happened because you were across that bridge in that town.

Now, I'll get there soon enough, but you've got to go now.

Tell you what-- I'm gonna feed Lily and I'll come back in 10 minutes.

Hey, Nora--

10 minutes, Matt.

And then I'll take her back in, I promise.

Okay, thank you.

You're very welcome.

Hey, where'd you steal her from?

That's not your baby. That's not your baby.

That's not her baby.

Meg: You know her?

She's your dad's girlfriend, right?

She sprayed me with a hose once.

I liked her.

Are you scared for them? For your family?

There is no family.

Where'd you hear that?

I thought that's the point.

No, Tom.

That's not the point at all.

Family is everything.

Here we go.

Sorry, ma'am. Park's closed today.

Really? Why?

It's October 14th.

It's the anniversary of the Departure.

It's a time for the townfolks to be with themselves, reflect.

Reflect on what?

I'm sorry?

Well, nothing happened here to the townsfolk.

It's kind of like a temple closing down on Christmas.

Not really your holiday, don't you think?

I'm sorry, ma'am, but unless you have a wristband or a dispensation form, I'm gonna have to ask you to turn around.

I have 35 pounds of plastic expl*sive.

Will that work?

What?

Ranger: Whoa!

Stop! Someone-- Hey!

Ranger: We have a runner on the bridge.

We have a runner on the bridge.

Ranger #2: Go, let's go!

Let's go!

[crowd murmuring]

[keys jingle]

Stop!

Get down on the ground now!

I said get down!

Get on the ground now!

Get in there, cuff her.

We got an unauthorized vehicle on the bridge.

Possible code blue. I repeat, possible code blue.

[door opens]

[dogs barking]

Which one is yours?

What?

Well, they took your dog when you got here, right?

Which one is he?

I know we're not here to talk about my dog, John.

No, that's exactly why we're here, Kevin.

You tell me where my daughter is and I'll let you take your dog home.

I don't know where your daughter is, but I know she didn't depart.

No? Well, what did she do?

She staged it.

She and her friends, to make it look like--

And you know this how?

I saw her do it.

You saw her do it and you waited all this time to tell me?

I didn't remember until this morning.

What sparked it, this memory?

What do you want me to tell you, John?

I want you to tell me the truth.

What made you remember?

I died.

I had a-- a problem.

Michael took me to his grandfather's.

He said he could help. He gave me, like, a--

My son took you to meet his grandfather?

Yeah, Virgil. He helped me.

No, Michael wouldn't do that.

Listen, man, he did. I swear, man, he did.

Prove it.

The old man told me what he did to you.

I'm so sorry.

I'm sorry. No one should ever--

Man, shut the f*ck up. That's a lie.

He didn't do nothing to me. You don't know shit.

All right, now-- look, let's stay focused, man, because, see, I want to make sure I get this.

Yeah.

You saw my daughter pretend to disappear and the only reason you remember that today is because you came back from the dead?

I know you don't think it can happen here, John, but it did.

You're right, Kevin. That can't happen here.

But I need you to explain me this.

Evie loved her mother.

She loved her brother.

And she loved me.

So why in God's name would she do this to us?

I don't know.

Okay, well, take a f*cking guess.

Maybe she didn't.

What?

Love you.

Who knows what goes through people's heads?

You know, your daughter--

What's going on?

John, it's Evie. Follow us.

What?

Evie!

John, you gotta get back.

No, you have got to let me through.

We can't. There's a b*mb in the trailer.

What?

Buddy, you gotta go back.

John, you gotta get back. The trailer is rigged with expl*sives.

Why-- why would anybody do-- Evie!

What happened?

Can I borrow those?

It's the three girls.

What three girls?

The ones who departed.

No, no, no, no.

We won't be able to get back in.

October 14th.

Four years ago.

Everywhere else in the world, they knew something had happened.

Yeah.

Massey: But we didn't.

No.

Not until the phones started ringing.

Till we turned on our televisions.

And we ran out onto the streets.

Found each other.

Woman: Yes, we did.

Massey: And everyone asked the same question-- is everyone okay?

Is everyone still here?

Congregation: Yes.

Massey: And we were.

Congregation: Amen.

Massey: We were still here.

Congregation: Amen.

Massey: We were--

[people whispering]

[whispering]

Michael has asked to say a few words.

My mom tells a story.

A lot of you have probably heard it.

She says that there was water trickling down the stairs in our house.

And when she followed it up, she saw that it was coming from the bathroom.

[light laughter]

She opened the door and she swears a wave just washed past her.

[laughter]

And there were me and Evie, five years old and an overflowing tub.

My mom says she asked Evie why she did it.

And my sister said, ""I just wanted to see what would happen.""

[laughter]

That's the story that you always tell and everyone laughs, even me and Evie.

She laughed to protect you, Mom, because it's not the truth.

I'm the one who turned the water on.

I turned it on all the way because Evie was crying so loud and she didn't want you to hear.

She was crying because we didn't know why our father was gone.

Or why he did what he did.

But she was crying so loud.

So I turned the water on and I drowned her out.

Until she could pretend she was okay.

Nobody disappeared from here on October 14th four years ago.

But they did before.

And after.

We are the 9,261.

We are not spared.

Everybody, back up.

Get off the bridge!

Erika!

Are you just gonna blow yourself up?

'Cause if that's what it is, I'm not leaving this bridge, Evangeline.

I'm not.

You're just gonna have to blow me up, too.

Get out of my way!

We need to go now.

Okay, my car's over there. We can pack--

No, we're going in.

Matt.

Mary, I need you to trust me.

We need to get you and the baby back in.

Now is our chance. Do you trust me?

Yes.

Okay, let's go.

Matt, wait.

Wait!

She's not yours.

Hey! Hey!

Hey!

Yeah?

We're aware this isn't your jurisdiction.

You're a police officer, right?

Uh, that's right.

Something terrible is happening in the lobby bar.

Another officer, he's being attacked.

I think they're gonna k*ll him.

I'll be right there.

Man: Yeah.

[applause] - Thank you, thank you.

Thank you very much.

You're all lovely people.

Who's next? Who wants to sing a song?

Who wants to spin the wheel?

An officer of the law.

Will you regale us with a tune, Officer?

No.

Woman: I will. I want to.

All right, darling. Come on up.

[applause]

The stage is yours.

We met on the bridge. You tied a noose around my neck.

Oh, sure. I remember.

The uniform threw me off.

Did you call me?

Call you?

I got a call. There was a cop getting attacked down here.

Huh. Only cop I see around here is you, Officer.

Suppose this crowd could turn on anyone if they can't sing for shit.

Just tell me what I need to do to get back.

Why do you want to go back?

Because I have a family. Because I love them and I--

Yes, you love your family. It's not your time.

[chuckles] Still got so much to live for.

Oh, come on, be original, mate.

Why should you go back and the rest of us--

Because I deserve to.

You deserve to?

[chuckles]

Yes. Now tell me how.

I already did.

Excuse me?

If you want to get out of here, all you have to do is sing.

I don't believe you.

Why not?

Because it's stupid.

Ah, the trial, it's beneath you.

It's not elegant enough. Too easy.

You pushed a little girl into a well.

You don't want to sing?

[applause]

Who's next? Anybody?

You're right. Don't do it. It's stupid.

How about you, Officer? You want a turn?

[chuckles]

Give it a whirl.

Oh, that's a great one.

Okay, the words are gonna come up right there.

Smile.

I'm just looking for a sense.

And what kind of a sense are you looking for?

A sense of when.

When what?

You know what.

Oh, you mean the wedding?

I'm just looking for a season, honey, because if it's spring, then...

Mom, we're figuring it out.

Fine, fine. I withdraw.

Here you go, ladies.

Oh, I'm so sorry, but I ordered this without the walnuts.

Oh, of course.

Thank you.

Let me take care of that.

Thank you.

I did say no walnuts?

You sure did, yeah.

Let me pay for the wedding.

You are relentless.

Look who's talking.

I'm not relentless.

Megan, you're the most relentless person I've ever known.

When you have a cause, there's no stopping you.

I can't let you pay.

Why not? I treat you all the time.

I treated you to those boots.

What boots?

Those boots that you saw at Bergdorf's.

I didn't have my wallet and I said I would pay you back.

Well, that was March. This is October.

Megan, no. Forget it. Please, no.

Do you remember how much they were?

Megan, forget it.

I think it was 400.

No, honey, I don't want your money.

I insist.

Fine, fine.

What's today? October what?

The 13th.

But 13 is unlucky. Date it tomorrow.

October 14.

[rips check]

Thank you for the loan.

So once I deposit this, you'll let me pay for the wedding?

[both laugh]

Oh, I just thought of something that I have to tell you.

I really have to pee. Is it gonna take a while?

A minute or two.

Fine. Go, go, go.

But don't let me forget.

I'll be right back.

And ladies don't say pee.

Ranger: All right. Hey, folks, thanks for coming out to visit us.

Please forgive us as we're a little rough around the edges right now. We've only been up and running for a couple of months.

On your left as you get off, there'll be golf carts and audio tours.

And please make sure we see those wristbands at all times.

Now, the park closes at sundown.

So if you ain't on that last bus, we're gonna come hunt you down.

[laughter]

Welcome to Miracle. Come on!

We're not doing the audio tour.

Oh, hell, yes, we are.

[music playing on headphones]

Recorded voice: It's pretty common for folks to get confused about where you've come to visit today, so let's clear it up. The moment you cross the bridge, you enter the town of Jarden. Miracle is the national park that surrounds and protects that town from those who would corrupt its exceptional properties.

[bells dings]

Historic site number seven. Some say the earthquakes that occur in Jarden are a result of man-made fracking and wastewater disposal in nearby towns. But this crack in the street wasn't caused by a quake. It was the result of a gas expl*si*n in the sewage system on October the 14 that sent manhole covers flying a few blocks over. Instead of repairing the damage, the town has left it as a reminder.

[bell dings]

Historic site number 13. This is Cecilia's place. It turns out that the gown she tried on that afternoon wasn't even her cup of tea. Then when she heard what happened around the world on October the 14, she bought it immediately. And to this day, Cecilia still wears that dress for a few hours just in case.

Y'all want a picture?

Oh, we're good.

Thank you.

Let's go. Let's go.

Nice dress.

There's no number. Why are you stopping?

There's a man in there who can help me.

Jesus, Meg.

Another psychic?

I've heard amazing things about him.

This is why we took a road trip to Texas, this guy?

He's only been doing readings for a few weeks and they say that he's the real deal.

I want you to find what you're looking for, I do.

How's this guy gonna be any different from any of the others?

Because this place is different.

It's special.

And he's from here.

[music playing]

So... she died the day before the Departure?

Uh-huh.

Oh.

Honey, I'm really sorry.

It was two years ago. I'm okay.

People say I'm lucky.

How's that?

That I know what happened to her, where she went.

Wow.

You lose your mama and the very next day nobody gives a shit about her or you because they think the world is ending.

Lucky. [scoffs]

Please, have a seat. Make yourself comfortable, please.

You need my handprint?

No, that is for people who want to know their future.

You don't want to do that.

I brought one of her sweaters.

Chilly?

No, I... I just...

I mean, the others wanted something that belonged to her.

Well, Miss Abbott, I don't need anything from her.

But... I need something from you.

Just chew that.

It's safe. Don't swallow it.

Here, just spit it here.

In your hand?

Yeah, in my hand.

[exhales]

Mm...

[sighs]

What do you want to know?

You can just ask her?

You can ask me.

What do you want to know?

She was gonna tell me something just before I got up from the table to go to the bathroom.

I want to know what it was, what she was gonna tell me.

You know, people on their deathbeds, they have a chance to put their last words together, make them count.

Say something profound, poetic.

But usually when folk don't know that they're about to die, they... well, no disrespect to your mother or anything, Miss Abbott, they say a lot of stupid shit.

What do you mean?

I can tell you what you want, but I've been doing this long enough to know that no matter what I say, you're gonna be disappointed because it's not gonna fix what's broke inside.

Bullshit.

Sorry?

You don't know.

You're not f*cking real.

I'm gonna be disappointed because whatever it is that you're about to tell me is f*cking bullshit.

Walnuts.

What?

Your mother sent her salad back because she asked for no walnuts.

She was very polite about it, though.

Are you sure you want to know?

Tell me.

Darren: Well?

He wasn't the real deal.

[music playing on P.A.]

Ranger on P.A.: All right, folks, five minutes. We've got five minutes till the first bus gets here.

[sighs]

[crying]

Want a baby carrot?

[sniffles] What?

You can't cry while you eat them. It's impossible.

Thanks.

Ranger on P.A.: Folks, please make sure your vendor number is clear and visible at your stalls.

Is it working?

Shit.

I would tell you a joke, but I don't know any.

Ranger on P.A.: All right, folks, two minutes. We have two minutes till the first bus.

Knock, knock.

Who's there?

Broken pencil.

Broken pencil who?

Never mind. It's pointless.

I'm Evie.

Meg.

I'm sorry you didn't find whatever you were looking for here.

No one ever does.

Darren: Who was that?

She gave me some carrots.

Let's get out of here.

Ranger on P.A.: Let's go ahead forward, folks. We'll be leaving in two minutes. Two minutes.

[grenade rolling]

[children whimpering]

[children screaming]

Let us out!

[screaming continues]

What about the bus?

If you want to have a conversation, let's just have a conversation.

We thought we had an understanding after the incident with the dogs.

But a school bus, Megan?

We don't target children.

Why not? Nobody got hurt.

For the same reason we don't allow them to live in our houses.

The authorities would overreact.

We stone each other to death, but we're afraid of the authorities?

Please, can you explain that to me?

Explanations are useless.

Don't give me that mysterious bullshit.

That's what you say to them.

I've been inside for almost a year now and I need to know.

Need to know what?

Why we're not f*cking stepping it up.

They're forgetting.

And if I'm supposed to be a living reminder, it's not enough for me to stand outside of their f*cking houses staring at them until they start screaming in my face.

Why do I have to just stand there when I can put my cigarette out in their f*cking eye?

That's a reminder.

Violence is weakness.

You're wrong.

And I'm not the only one that feels that way.

Are you contacting the heads of other houses again, Megan?

Why would I be doing that?

There are rumors you're planning your own action on October 14.

I'm not authorized to plan my own action.

Just like you're not trying to purchase plastic expl*sives?

That's ridiculous.

It is ridiculous, Megan.

So I take it you and your house will be present at the Heroes Day celebration in Dobbs Ferry?

Absolutely.

We've been painting our signs all week.

[sighs]

You will be in Dobbs Ferry with your members and you will carry out the action.

Mm-hmm.

I need to hear you say it.

You can count on me.

Can we, Megan?

Because we counted on you to handle this.

We lost 10 members from New Rochelle last week.

Apparently he's hugging their pain away.

I wanted to do what he could do.

I wanted to be something.

So I said yes.

And he wrapped his arms around me and I felt everything I was, everything I would be.

I felt it get born and die over and over again.

I had been afraid to use it.

Afraid of...

Afraid of what it meant.

Of what came next.

But I knew I couldn't let you hurt anymore, not if I can take it away.

I'm not afraid anymore.

So... who wants a hug?

Hello.

Hi.

What's your name?

Kristin.

Do you want me to take your pain away, Kristin?

Thank you.

Hi.

What's your name?

It's Meg, right?

Do you want me to take your pain away, Meg?

I can do this for real.

[door opens]

[door closes]

Laurie: Hey.

Did you forget about Paramus?

I had 30 people there waiting to see you.

I tried to call you. You didn't pick up.

I had to give their donations back.

Donations?

What?

You mean their money?

You had to give their money back.

Well, we're gonna need money if we're ever gonna get the permanent space.

We don't need a permanent space.

Yes, we do, Tommy.

It's been a month and renting out these halls is very expensive.

I don't want their money and I don't want to build a f*cking church.

When they pay us, that is their commitment to change, okay?

If it were free, it wouldn't work.

We're helping people.

We?

I'm the one up here lying.

You're not lying.

We stole it, Mom.

You said that if we took Wayne's story and used it, people would believe in us the way they believed in him.

Well, they're getting better. Isn't that what matters?

It works!

It doesn't work on me.

Did something happen?

Yeah.

Something happened.

Your book didn't work out, so you figured... you figured you would pimp out your own f*cking son so that you wouldn't have to run people over anymore.

So that you didn't have to feel bad about leaving your whole f*cking family.

[chairs clatter]

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

Tommy, I'm so sorry.

Tommy. Tommy, please.

[chairs clatter]

I'm sorry.

[groans]

Stay.

[dog whining]

[whines]

[people coughing]

Hey, everybody!

Remember me?

I was here a month ago trying to recruit you.

I just wanted you to come get better with some great group therapy from my mommy.

You!

You. I tried to recruit you.

You looked so sad.

Then you blew your f*cking whistle at me.

You blew the whistle and they came and put me in a f*cking van that brought me to Meg.

Hmm?

Meg. You know Meg?

You know Meg?

You know Meg, huh?

You know her? Where's your whistle?

Where's your whistle?!

Where's your f*cking whistle?

Where is it?

Blow your f*cking whistle!

Blow the whistle that brings Meg.

Where is she?

Where the f*ck is Meg?

[punch lands]

[Tom grunts]

[grunts]

[coughing]

What do you want?

You said you could do it for real.

Do what?

Take my pain away.

Why don't you just hug yourself?

Please.

I'll do anything. I just want to be a part of this.

You don't understand this.

You're not looking for this.

You're looking for a family.

If I wanted a f*cking family, I'd move to Texas.

What?

Texas.

They moved there, my dad and my sister.

Where in Texas?

Miracle.

Jarden.

What?

The town is Jarden.

Miracle is the national park that surrounds and protects it from those who would corrupt its exceptional properties.

I just so happen to be headed there myself.

No, no, alone. I'll be there in the morning.

Not knowing what's gonna happen.

You must be curious about what I'm gonna do when we get to Texas.

Are you, Tom?

'Cause it's pretty f*cking amazing what I'm gonna do.

Why'd you f*ck me?

I know why you poured gasoline on me.

I know why you thr*at me, to try to send a message to my mom.

But why did you f*ck me?

Oh, look.

A h*nky-tonk.

You wanna go dancing, Tom?

[music playing]

[billiard balls clack]

Thank you.

Mmm.

Your turn.

If you're not gonna drink...

Now we're talking.

So who's the blonde?

What?

Both your parents have dark hair.

You know my dad?

The former chief.

Nice guy.

Yeah, he's not my biological father.

But he raised you, right?

Yeah.

Yeah, he and my mother got together when I was four.

He adopted me.

Oh, yeah?

My dad died when I was a baby.

Then my mom got remarried to this guy Elliot.

He wanted us to be an official family.

I was really young, but I remember going down to the courthouse and everything.

The judge gave me a lollipop.

[laughs]

Good old Elliot.

He left my mom a year later and I never saw him again.

Can we get two more? Please?

You got it.

Thank you.

Yeah.

So where's your mom now?

She's in space.

What?

When she died, we had her cremated and we sh*t her ashes into space.

Seriously?

She didn't like the idea of being in a box, you know, in the ground.

And she was really into astrology.

There's this company and they do it.

Costs $12,000.

Seems reasonable, right?

Just f*cking tell me.

Somebody got on the property.

Come on. Just let me go.

I didn't do anything.

There's a bike trail about a mid the property.

Guess he decided to go off it.

Where'd you find him?

Right outside the barn.

Did he see?

Yeah, we think so.

What? What did I see? I didn't see anything.

I don't know even know what you're talking about.

We can just keep him here until tomorrow.

Once it's over, it won't matter anymore.

Stone him.

What does that... what did she say?

What does that mean?

Hey! Wait, guys!

Please, just let me go! Please! Just let me go!

Hey.

What are you doing?

I was following you.

I don't want you to follow me.

You wanted to come here, and you're here.

And now we're done.

It's Matt.

Matt Jamison from Mapleton.

Oh, yeah.

The priest.

You're talking.

[chuckles]

Mm-hmm.

So you left them, the Remnant?

I sure did.

Good for you.

So Kevin and Nora have been taking care of Mary and I'm immensely grateful for that.

So the rangers just won't let you in?

Their rules are very particular.

Well, that doesn't seem fair.

No, it doesn't.

[chuckles] I can't get over it.

What?

Well, seeing you here in Texas.

[Chuckles] What?

It's pretty amazing, don't you think?

Not really.

I mean, if we were just anywhere, it would be a coincidence, but we're here in Miracle.

I think we both came here for the same reason.

What reason is that?

Because this place is safe.

Now that you've left the Remnant.

Exactly.

It was really hard to get away, you know, because they're everywhere.

But I started to think to myself, there must be somewhere that the Guilty Remnant wouldn't work, you know?

Wouldn't work?

Right, because in order to get someone to join them, that person needs be in pain.

And the people on the other side of that bridge, Matt, they were spared.

They're just not suffering like the rest of us are.

You know, Megan, I don't think you're being entirely honest with me.

You think I'd lie to a priest?

Today is the anniversary, isn't it?

Of the Departure? No, I believe that's tomorrow.

Not the Departure. Your mother's death.

You do remember attacking me in Mapleton?

I was outside your house handing out fliers with your mother's photo on them.

I know it was cruel. I'm sorry for digging into your life like that, but I was doing everything I could to make you feel again.

I had forgotten that.

Well, then I apologize for being your living reminder.

Can I ask you something?

Sure.

What you waiting for?

I'm sorry?

You and all these people out here, you're so close.

It's right there.

Just over the bridge.

You want it, but you're not doing anything to get it.

So what are you waiting for?

You want me to tell you?

Yes.

You're waiting for me.

[snoring]

Who are you?

[pen scratching]

[coughing]

[gasping]

[panting]

[TV squealing]

Ah!

[knocking on door]

[knocking]

Mr. Harvey?

It's Garvey.

No, it's Harvey.

May I bring them in, please?

Um, give me a second. I'll take them.

Thanks.

[door creaks]

All I have is euros.

[grunting]

[panting]

[elevator bell dings]

[alarm blaring]

[wings fluttering, bird chirping]

[static hisses]

Yeah, I see it.

It's flying around the lobby.

Woman: Oh, the bird just landed.

Woman #2: Stand back, everyone.

Hello.

Sorry, there's a bird in here.

May I help you, sir?

Yes, someone sent some flowers to my room.

Do you know who sent them?

All deliveries come through the concierge.

You'll have to ask him.

[bird chirping]

Man: Get that out of there.

What the f*ck is happening?

The fire alarm went off, sir, and we have a bird loose in the lobby.

What?

Where are we? What is this?

Sir, please lower your voice.

Are you a guest here?

No, I'm not a guest.

I took poison in your trailer. You sent me here.

You know me.

You know me. You sent me here.

Clearly, sir, you're upset.

I'm writing down the name and number of a professional who can help you.

I don't need a professional. I need you to tell me--

Here.

I wish I could be more helpful.

I really hope they don't catch that bird.

[phone rings]

Concierge. May I help you?

Yes.

Absolutely.

Right away.

Shit.

Hey!

Hey!

Come on. Come on.

Come on. Come on.

Help!

[coughing]

Can you hear me? You okay?

You okay?

[door opens]

Hey, what are you doing?

She was floating in the pool. She almost drowned.

What did I tell you?

You don't know how to swim.

Hey, take it easy.

Mind your f*cking business.

[electricity buzzing]

[women whispering in Spanish]

[continues in Spanish]

Why are you wet?

There was a girl in the pool.

She was drowning, so--

Did you drink any?

What?

The water, did you drink any?

No.

And don't.

No matter what, don't drink the water here.

And where is here?

You mean the hotel?

No, it's not a f*cking hotel.

Someone just tried to k*ll me.

Oh.

Oh?

Well, it makes sense.

It's a pitfall of your chosen occupation.

Which is what?

Look at the way you're dressed, man.

You're an international assassin.

Are you f*cking serious?

That is why you checked into the hotel, isn't it?

I didn't check into the hotel.

I drank that shit that you gave me and I woke up in a bathtub.

Okay, Kevin, you've got to stop thinking in such straight lines, because she surely will not be.

She thinks in spirals and helixes and zigzags and circles.

Patti?

Your target.

She's here, now?

She will be in a couple of hours.

It's for her campaign.

Her what?

Her campaign.

She's running for president.

What the f*ck are you talking about?

Okay, I've only got time to say this once, all right?

And you're only gonna get one sh*t at it.

You understand?

No.

Okay, you're registered under Kevin Harvey.

You made a generous contribution to her campaign which guarantees you a meet and greet.

When she gets here, they will call you in your room.

Then they will bring you down to her suite where you will be searched for w*apon.

Once inside, you ask to use the washroom.

Inside the washroom in the t*nk of the toilet, you will find a g*n and a sil*ncer.

You walk out, you point that g*n and you do not hesitate, Kevin.

You do not hesitate because she will try and deceive you.

You point the g*n at her head and you pull the trigger.

And that's it.

It'll all be over.

And you will be delivered from this place.

And you can go home, Kevin.

It's Kevin Harvey?

Mm-hmm.

And the g*n's gonna be in the toilet.

Yeah.

Like ""The Godfather""?

[chuckles]

Exactly like ""The Godfather.""

Got it.

And do not-- do not hesitate.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

How are you here?

Sorry?

If I had to die to get here, what are you doing here?

Atoning.

[tires squeal]

Just don't leave the room until they call you, Kevin.

It's not safe.

And for God's sake, don't let them see you.

- [TV squealing]

[overlapping voices]

f*ck!

Man: Feed that f*ck fire.

I think I see something.

[fire alarm blaring]

Recording: We're sorry for the inconvenience, but we need to evacuate the hotel.

Please move in an orderly fashion to the nearest available stairwell.

I think they want us to evacuate.

False alarm.

What if it's not?

Then we'll f*cking burn.

Please move in an orderly fashion to the nearest available stairwell.

[speaking Spanish]

Those for me?

Is your name Mary Jamison?

No.

Then they're not for you.

Woman: Okay, ladies and gentlemen. It's safe to return to your rooms. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Is your name Kevin Harvey?

[grunting]

[elevator bell dings]

[groaning]

[elevator bell dings]

[door opens]

[door closes]

What the f*ck am I doing--

Hello.

I work with Senator Levin.

I apologize, but we need to vet anyone who gets close to her.

We just need to make sure you belong here.

[machine whining]

Gladys: State your name, please.

Kevin Harvey.

[machine chirping]

[machine beeps]

Ow! Whoa.

Hey, hey! No! Ow! f*ck!

Ah!

I'm sorry if this seems severe, but we do need to trust each other.

Please state your name.

Kevin Garvey. Garvey.

You checked into the hotel under a different name. Why?

Because I don't want anyone to know who I really am.

Well, it's a pretty lousy alias.

[chuckles] Thanks.

$50,000, that's a lot of money.

Yeah.

What do you expect in return?

I just really want to be in the same room as her.

You want to be in the same room with her?

Mm-hmm.

Uh-huh. Do you smoke, Kevin?

Yes.

Why do you smoke?

Because I'm addicted to nicotine.

[buzzes]

Ow! f*ck!

Ow! No, no, no! Ah! Ah!

Ah! Ow!

Why do you smoke?

I smoke to remember.

Remember what?

That the world ended.

Uncuff him.

Mm, my manners. Thirsty?

No.

[buzzes]

The senator is arriving imminently.

Why don't you go freshen up?

We'll come get you when she's ready.

Oh, and, Mr. Garvey, we're thankful for your support.

- [TV squealing]

[static hissing]

[voices overlapping]

Man: It's the same f*cking room. Feed that f*ck fire. I think I see something.

Dad?

God damn.

It worked. [laughs]

Where are you?

I'm in Perth.

Jesus, we're staying in the same room.

What?

Son, I am f*cked up on this shit they call God's Tongue, so I really hope this is real.

You get the flowers I sent?

Uh...

Yeah, the card was blank.

It didn't say get to the well?

What well?

Take her to the well.

[fire alarm blaring]

Who, Patti?

Wake the f*ck up, assh*le. Feed the fire.

What well?

I'm supposed to assassinate her.

No, you're not a f*cking assassin.

Whoa. Whoa. Don't f*cking put it out.

I'm still talking to him.

You've got to take her to the well.

What well?

Son, you have to be strong.

I love you.

I love you, too.

Whoa.

Dad?

Dad?

[knocking on door]

Senator Levin's ready to see you now.

- [chatter]

[phones ringing]

Make like Jesus.

Sorry?

Oh.

Congratulations.

What happened to your hand?

Cut it.

Did you put Neosporin on it?

Yeah.

He's all clear.

He's harmless.

Hey.

Long time no see.

Yeah.

Sorry about the unpleasantness before, but you can't be too safe.

Water under the bridge?

Yeah, water under the bridge.

Great. Okay.

Well, the senator will be up any minute now and you are welcome to talk about anything you'd like for five minutes or so as long as you don't ask her about North Korea, g*n control, abortion or Neil.

Her ex-husband.

Oh, yeah.

Okay? Great.

Okay.

The photo will be right here.

And don't blink when the flash goes off.

The senator will only give you one sh*t.

So don't blink.

I won't.

Good. Any questions?

Yeah, could I use your restroom?

Oh, yes. Be my guest.

Down the hall.

Great. Thank you.

Occupied, mate.

May I have some privacy, please?

Yeah, sorry.

Gladys: Thirsty?

No, I'm fine, thanks.

The senator is in the elevator.

She'll be here momentarily.

[door opens]

I know you, don't I?

I don't think so.

Are you sure?

Have you been to one of these campaign events before?

Gladys: This is his first. Water?

Oh, yes, please, Gladys.

You know what's crazy?

I feel like I was sitting on the toilet the last time I met you.

[laughs] That is crazy.

No, that's déjà vu.

That's the mind taking an event you're experiencing in the present moment and mistaking it for a memory.

The mind. [laughs]

You cannot trust the mind, for it will play tricks on you.

And we all know who tricks are for.

Kids.

[laughs]

I'm gonna use the restroom.

Copy that. Standing by.


She's here.

[door opens]

Hello, hello, hello.

Gladys: Senator, this is Kevin Garvey.

Kevin?

So nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you, too.

Would you like some water, Senator?

Never touch the stuff.

Kevin, I'm sorry about all the security.

I don't know if Gladys told you, but we received credible intelligence that someone may be trying to assassinate me.

Now why do you think someone would want to do that?

m*rder me?

Well, I don't know.

It's because I stick to you, Kevin.

[laughs]

Throughout history assassins have never been motivated by money or revenge.

They're motivated by beliefs.

And their targets embody a belief that enrages their would-be assassins.

Why?

Because secretly, they share that belief.

John Wilkes Booth loved black people.

Hated slavery. Hated it.

Did you know that?

I did not, Senator.

Well, he did.

But he still popped Lincoln right in his stovepipe.

Bang. Emancipated from life.

So I'm gonna ask you again.

Why do you think someone would want to k*ll me?

You tell me.

Because they'd rather put a b*llet in my head than accept my truth.

And what is your truth?

Well, shit, Kevin, you wrote me a check for $50,000.

What do you think my truth is?

You want to destroy families.

Write that down.

That is f*cking brilliant.

Our polls say our message is confusing.

You just nailed it.

I want to destroy families.

The other day I was in Northboro, Iowa, and I met a young man.

I was working my way through the crowd shaking hands and I see this fellow and he's waiting for me and he has a baby in his arms.

And I'm thinking to myself, ""Shit, now I'm gonna have to kiss that thing because that's what one must endure if you want to get elected.""

So I pucker up and you know what that young man does?

He hands me the baby and he just walks away.

He gave me his child and he disappeared.

Police couldn't find him.

No wife or mother stepped forward to claim it.

And that baby is now in an orphanage and it's gonna be fine.

It's gonna be fine.

It's gonna grow up and it's gonna have difficulty attaching to people and it's gonna have difficulty giving and accepting love.

But, Kevin, that is no longer a difficulty.

It is a strength.

It is a survival mechanism.

Because on October 14, attachment and love became extinct.

In an instant, it became cosmically, abundantly clear that you can lose anyone at any time.

Our cave collapsed, Kevin.

Now, we can spend all our time digging through the rubble looking for signs of life, or we can transform.

Do you mind if I ask you, Kevin, how you first heard about what we are trying to do?

How you heard about the Guilty Remnant?

No.

My wife left me. Joined up.

Patti: That must have been painful.

Mm-hmm.

No more painful than when Neil left you.

Okay, we are done here.

No, that's okay, Gladys.

Wayne, will you sh**t this f*ck in the face for me?

Whoa, whoa.

Patti: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

I'm kidding. [laughing]

Oh.

[Wayne laughs]

Lighten up, guys.

[laughter]

My donors have been warned not to use that name, but fortunately I don't give a shit about Neil.

He gave lots of shits.

Well, received, technically.

- Right on his chest.

[laughs]

Well, anyhoo, f*ck Neil.

[laughs] Let's get that photo done, shall we?

Yeah.

[clears throat]

Oh, do you mind if I use the bathroom?

Remember to leave the seat down.

Okay, I will.

[water running]

[coughs]

[cocks g*n]

[water stops]

[inhales]

[exhales]

Shit!

[silenced g*n]

[silenced g*n]

No! No, I'm not her!

[Gladys groans]

[silenced g*n]

[Boston accent] Please, please, stop.

I'm not her. I'm not Patti Levin.

My name is Rhonda Gennero, I'm from Lowell, Massachusetts.

They found me on Facebook.

The campaign, they paid me. They paid me.

They even sent me to Colombia...

[stammering] for plastic surgery so I'd look even more like her.

I'm-- I'm a double.

I'm a decoy.

I've never even met her.

Whatever she's done to you, please, please don't k*ll me.

I'm not her.

Good-bye, Patti.

No!

Why am I still here?

You said as soon as I was done, it'd be over.

Why isn't it over?

Why isn't what over?

Stop f*cking with me.

I'm sick of meeting in f*cking parking garages.

I did it, I did what you told me to do.

Why am I still here?

Still-- still where?

[bird chirping]

Man: Oh, jeez!

I got it.

I got it, people. I got the bird.

[applause]

Thank you.

Sorry about that, sir. Now how can I help you?

Did you drink the water?

The-- but I was--

I was so thirsty.

Okay.

[elevator bell dings]

[elevator bell dings]

She locked me out.

[chuckles] Looks like you're locked out, too.

Hey.

You want a drink?

Yeah, I do.

What's your name?

Kevin.

You here on business or pleasure, Kevin?

Uh, business.

Oh, yeah? Well, what line of work you in?

I'm an international assassin.

No shit.

No shit.

I wouldn't think they'd let you guys drink.

Oh, no, I'm done for the day.

I eliminated my target.

Turns out she was using a body double.

Like Saddam Hussein.

Yeah.

They really do that, huh?

I guess they do.

Wow, international assassin.

You get to travel the world k*ll people.

No consequences.

No wife. No kids.

No responsibility.

That's a great job. I can see why you picked it.

Yeah.

What do you do?

Me?

I don't do anything. I'm f*cking dead.

Choked on a piece of chicken.

[laughs]

Which is why we should always do what our moms say.

Chew before you swallow. [laughs]

Now I'm stuck in this stupid hotel.

Half the people, they can't even remember their own names.

The other half, they're running around doing crazy shit like international assassins.

And I can't find a single woman to take a dump on me.

What?

What, you gonna judge me now?

Is your name Neil?

Yeah.

Why?

That little girl in the room is not your daughter, is she?

Oh, you think there's a little girl in my room?

Yeah.

I saved her from the pool.

Well, you should have let that fat c**t drown.

Hey, bud.

[bone snaps]

[knocks]

Hi, Kevin.

Hi, Patti.

Are we leaving now?

Yeah.

Do you know where we're going?

I think so.

Hello there.

Can I help you, sir?

Uh... yeah.

We were actually looking for a well.

A well?

Yeah.

Um, okay, well, let me see.

Are you sure it's not the caverns?

Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's a well.

Oh.

Oh, here we are.

Well, in Jarden, Texas.

I'm not sure what the hours are, but if you head out now, I'm sure you could get there by sunrise.

It's a straight sh*t out the I-55.

Can't miss it.

Great.

Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

You two have a safe trip to the well.

Thanks.

He's gonna throw me in.

Oh.

Well, then I hope you have your swimsuit with you, young lady.

""With the arrival of the European explorers, the land we now know as Texas was populated by the tribes of 'in-diggen-ous' people.""

Do you know what that means?

""In-diggen-ous""?

Yeah, it means native.

Like Indians.

""The Orphan-- the Orphan's Well outside Jarden was built by one of these tribes. According to the ancient legend, the well formed a conduit between the world of the living and the spirit world.""

Am I talking too much?

My dad says I talk too much.

He pushed me down the stairs one time.

I broke two of my grown-up teeth.

It's okay. Keep reading.

""For centuries, people have made pilgrimages to the well to throw in whatever they want to unburden themselves of.""

[sighs]

What's wrong?

It looks different.

Are you scared?

No.

[clucking]

I'm not scared.

[groans]

Stand up.

Walk.

What are you doing with that girl?

Who are you?

What are you doing with that girl?

Taking her to the well.

Why?

I'm gonna throw her in it.

The girl, is she resisting?

No.

I reckon that's because she wants you to do it.

Just like a woman.

She believes she can improve you.

I don't understand.

That's bloody obvious.

You have a choice.

Cross or jump.

Why would I jump?

Because you don't want to k*ll a child.

She's not a child.

Yes, she is.

And if you do this, it'll change you.

None of this is real.

Friend, this is more real than it's ever been.

How far is the well?

Just a mile.

There's no road. You'll have to walk.

[whispering]

Who is that man?

I don't know.

What did he say to you?

It's private.

Was it about me?

Nothing to do with you. Come on, we have to walk.

I'm tired.

I'll carry you.

Do you want to drop me in or do you want to push me in?

Pushing is probably easier.

What's wrong?

It's hard.

Why?

Because I feel sorry for you.

Would it help if I closed my eyes?

No.

Would it help if I say I deserve it?

That's not true.

Yes, it is.

I talk too much. I don't listen.

I'm stupid. I'm worthless. I'm a fat pig.

I don't know how to be happy.

Please stop, okay?

Okay.

Would it help if--

[gags]

[eagle screeching]

[screeching continues]

Patti: Help.

Please?

Kevin.

Please help me.

Oh!

You okay?

[groans]

I ever tell you I was on ""Jeopardy""?

What?

""Jeopardy"" the game show.

My plan was to win 50,000.

If I could do that, I could leave Neil.

Start over.

I just needed something that was mine.

I just needed to win.

50,000.

Going into Final Jeopardy, I had a little more than 7,000 bucks.

Stuart was the four-day reigning champ.

Know what he said to me in the greenroom before the game?

No. What?

Absolutely nothing.

Not a word.

There's a power to that.

Silence.

""Big countries.""

In area, the largest former Soviet republic after Russia and the largest nation that doesn't border an ocean.

What is Kazakhstan?

Correct.

I've always been good in geography.

You know what Stuart said?

What is the Ukraine?

The f*cking Ukraine.

Patti Levin is our new ""Jeopardy"" champion.

The next night I won again.

Third night, too.

Fourth night, I--

I b*mb.

But they let me keep everything before that.

$65,300.

More than I needed to leave him...

and start over.

But I didn't.

I'm scared, Kevin.

[crying]

[bubbling]

[rumbling]

[coughing]

[panting]

I woke up in a drained pond.

Patti: I was right there with you.

You found a rope and a cinder block and then you tied it to your ankle and you threw it into a g*dd*mn lake.

And if not for an act of divine intervention, you'd be gone.

Why are we losing?

Tommy: Because they're giving them something.

We can strip it away, but once it's gone, we have nothing to put back in its place.

Well, let's give them something.

Who wants a hug?

I know you go out there to pray with him.

Do you know what your father would do if he found out?

sh**t him again?

My son, Tommy, is he there with you?

No, he's not here. I've never even met him.

If you do see him, can you tell him I'm sorry?

I think I just made your sister uncomfortable.

You don't make me feel uncomfortable.

Have you been noticing that I've been kind of losing my mind?

I'm letting you handcuff me to the bed every night and we're acting like that's totally normal.

I've been seeing Patti Levin.

But she's dead.

Yeah.

What is she saying?

She's saying I never should have told you about her, that I just made a big mistake.

[distant dog barking]

[grunts]

Patti: She's gone.

Gonna be a hard day, buddy.

What?

She grabbed a suitcase, threw some clothes in, grabbed the baby and tiptoed out.

I told you not to tell her.

Bullshit.

Of course she ran off.

I sat right here and watched her do it.

Barely even looked at you.

If you saw her, where'd she put the key?

No idea.

Nora?

She's not here, Kevin.

[door opens]

Nora!

That's not her. She's gone.

Shut the f*ck up.

Who are you talking to?

Don't tell her.

Nobody.

[stammering]

Nora didn't leave me the key.

I think I... Can you run downstairs?

Where's Lily?

I guess she's with Nora.

Can you run downstairs? In my toolbox, grab my bolt cutters.

You guess she's with Nora?

Dad, what's going on?

Don't tell her.

Honey, can you just run down?

They're under the sink in the kitchen.

Patti: I remember the day Neil left me.

I went outside on my lawn and I sat there until the sprinklers turned on.

The whole f*cking world looked like all the green went out of it.

She didn't leave me. She wouldn't do that.

She would and she did.

Kind of didn't leave her any choice once you told her about me.

You tell your daughter, she gonna leave you, too.

It's for you.

Where did you find that?

What'd you do?

Just give me the letter, honey. It's... that's mine.

What'd you do?

Okay.

Jill, stop. Hey, stop it!

Jill, stop it right now. Give me that.

""Mary and the baby are with me. Don't call.""

So she just left?

No, I...

Jill. Jill, come on. Jill.

I can fix this, Jill.

Jill!

Honey.

[door slams]

Patti: Like I said, Kevin, hard day.

This is Nora. Leave a message or don't.

[beeps]

Hey, Nora, it's me.

I know you're in town because you got Mary with you.

I just need to know where you are, that's it.

I know what I said is crazy.

And... I'm not crazy.

We just need to talk about it, that's it.

And, uh... just please call me back.

I love you.

I hope she calls back.

Hey.

I was right.

About what?

Told you something was going on with them and now she's gone. She took Lily and she left.

Wait, wait, slow down. What happened?

What happened is my dad f*cked up.

Please, can you not...

Really? You want me to go outside to say f*ck?

Jill, come on.

f*ck. f*ck!

No lightning bolts, so...

Tell me.

He's losing his mind.

He and Nora have to handcuff themselves together every night so that he doesn't sleepwalk.

He doesn't even remember where he goes.

He sleepwalks?

And he talks to himself.

Actually, no, he doesn't talk to himself. He talks to someone else.

My grandpa did the exact same thing and then they locked him up in a mental institution.

He heard voices that weren't there.

How do you know they're not there?

Because they're not.

I talk to someone who's not there.

You mean God?

Uh-huh.

Is he the one that's telling you that we can fool around, but we can't f*ck?

Or is that Jesus? Or the Holy Ghost?

I get the three of those confused.

Which one is it that you're talking to?

Why aren't any of you guys talking to me?

Hello.

Hello!

You know, I can really use some f*cking help here.

We can't do it because I don't want to do it.

What?

Listen, I think you're amazing.

But we barely know each other and...

I don't know if I love you yet.

[laughs]

All right.

Thanks for the talk, Reverend.

Man: All right, I know this one.

Don't tell me.

Huh...

Hey, I'll be with you in just a sec.

Yeah. Sure.

God damn it, I know this. Hold on.

It's a duck.

Don't tell me now. Is it...

It's a f*cking duck.

Is it sobaka?

No, utka.

Sobaka is dog.

Oh, he's learning a language.

Damn it, utka. I knew that.

Hey, how you doing?

I'm good. How you doing?

I was wondering if you could help me out here.

How did you do that?

Tell him it was sex stuff.

I just wondered if you could just cut it off.

Well, let me get a look.

Yes, sir. That's police issue.

Yes, it is. I'm a cop.

Was a cop.

Well, if you want me to pick it open, I'm gonna have to see your badge or police ID or something.

Could you just do me a favor and cut it off?

It was a stupid accident.

Accident? Mm, honesty, Kevin.

Shut the f*ck up!

Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

Yeah, I'm sorry.

Just trying to help.

Ooh, that is rubbing you raw. I can tell.

So you got a plan here now?

That's your plan?

Hmm, seems ill-conceived to me.

Maybe if you just, I don't know, put it...

God damn it! Just shut up!

What do you want?

Sorry?

Why do you keep following me?

If you want me to do something, just f*cking say it.

[exhales]

I'm glad you finally asked, Kevin.

There is something you need to do.

In Cairo, Egypt, there is an ancient artifact.

It's in a museum now.

They found it in the tomb of Amenhotep.

Scholars call it the Wishing Cup.

You need to acquire this cup.

It's more of a chalice, actually.

It's gonna be heavily guarded, but you need to get it any way you can.

Because once you do, you need to fill it with your cum, Kevin.

And then you need to drink it down.

Every last drop.

[laughs] Jesus, Kevin!

I have no f*cking idea what you're supposed to do.

I don't have some assh*le with a halo giving me instructions.

I k*ll myself. Next thing I know, I'm saddled with you.

I'm just as f*cking lost as you are.instructions.

Please, just... leave me alone.

Please?

You're destroying my life.

You're destroying your life.

I just get to watch.

Please, just go away.

Please, Patti.

I'm begging you. Please.

What?

I guess it didn't work.

What?

It didn't work. She's still here.

I know you went to see him.

You don't remember?

Uh, Michael, um...

I need you to get out of my truck.

I'm not having a...

Her name's Patti, right?

The woman that you see.

Her name is Patti. She dresses in white.

How do you know that?

My grandfather told me.

Listen, if you want to get rid of her, he can help.

If you can't remember how to get there, I can give you directions.

[clears throat]

Two blocks up, make a left.

[engine starts]

Just wait here a minute, okay?

[knocks on door]

Hey, Pop. He's here.

Patti: Hallelujah.

Well, Kevin, that there looks like a fella who's a solution to all our problems.

Michael says you're a sleepwalker and you don't remember coming here.

No.

All right.

Well, come on in. We'll go over it again.

Just you.

Three's a crowd.

You remember seeing me at the visitors' center?

The day you got here.

You recall what I said to you?

You said you could help me with my situation.

Mm-hmm.

It's 'cause I felt her clinging on you.

Like that plastic they put over a plate of food so it won't go bad.

So I invited you over.

You pretended like you didn't know what I was talking about.

But later that night, you came knocking.

I can't remember being here.

Yeah, well, you were here.

Sat right there in that same chair.

Talking to me just like you're talking to me now.

If you were asleep, I certainly couldn't tell.

[thumps]

Wake up!

I'm not asleep.

Okay, I'll take your word for it.

Do you remember what I said when I was here?

Mm-hmm.

You told me who she was, Patti.

Told me how she k*ll herself right in front of you.

And ever since then, she wouldn't let you be.

Then you asked me how you could cast her out.

Sounds like a f*cking exorcism.

Oh, you people and that movie.

[chuckles]

Let me ask you something. You throwing up across the room yet?

Your head turning round and round?

No.

No, that's because she ain't in you, Kevin.

She's on you.

And if you want to get her off you, you can't do it on your turf.

You got to go to hers.

The other place.

How do I do that?

You die.

I don't... I don't understand.

You understood just fine the last time.

In fact, you grabbed a piece of my rope, picked up a cinder block from outside, then off you walked into the woods.

I told you you needed help. You needed a guide.

But you were itching to do battle, so off you went to do it.

Now, drowning's not the best way to cross.

No exit strategy.

And like I said, you need a guide.

But I'd reckon that quake happened right before you passed, opened up the ground, emptied out all that water.

Spared your life.

Which means either you got somebody looking out for you... or you've got yourself a most powerful adversary.

Who are you?

I'm just someone who once had an adversary of his own.

One that made me do terrible things.

And for those things...

I was sh*t... in the chest, in the belly... and in that foul machinery below the waist which transgressed the laws of man.

And when I went over...

I did battle with my adversary.

And I vanquished him.

And then, Kevin, I was reborn.

Michael's your grandson.

He is.

And his father John, he... he went to prison for attempted m*rder.

He did.

So what'd you do to him?

I hurt him.

I hurt him a long time ago.

And then he hurt me back.

And he freed me.

Now let me free you.

By k*ll me?

Temporarily.

Come on back when you're ready.

Any time, day or night.

Patti!

Patti Levin!

Where are you?

Are you f*cking hiding from me?

You come out right the f*ck now!

Patti: Jesus, Kevin.

Get a grip.

Where were you?

Around.

You lied to me.

Sorry?

Yeah.

That night you said you were with me the whole time.

You said you saw the girls disappear.

You said you saw me try and k*ll myself.

But you left out the f*cking part, Patti, where I went to him.

So what?

What would you have done if I told you that the solution to all your problems was a magical black man sitting out on the edge of town?

That's borderline r*cist is what that is.

He knows what you are.

He knows how to get rid of you.

Then why the f*ck are you out here in the woods calling for me?

This man gave you a solution and you ran.

You think I'm scared to do battle with you?

Oh, Kevin.

I am so desperate to do battle.

So let's go. Let's go back.

Right now.

Let's go f*cking die.

I have responsibilities.

I'm a father.

Maybe Jill would be better off.

[phone ringing]

This is Nora. Leave a message or don't.

[beeps] - Nora, can you call me back?

Please?

I need you, so just call me back.

What about what she needs?

[phone ringing]

Hello?

Man: Hey. This Kevin Garvey?

Yeah.

Ranger Carson calling from the bridge.

Visitors' center gave me your cell.

There's a woman at the gate asking for you.

Says she's your wife.

Is her name Nora? Nora Durst?

Hold on.

Are you Nora?

Says her name is Laurie.

Hello?

Is she there? Is she there right now?

Yes, sir, but I can't let her in without a wristband or reservation.

Who was that?

[tires squealing]

[drumming]

[car horns honking]

[ranger radio chatter]

I'm Kevin Garvey. You called me on the phone.

Oh, yeah, great. Hang on one sec.

Hey, Kevin Garvey's here.

Could you bring that lady on up?

She doesn't have an or anything, so you've got to talk to her at the fence.

Sure.


Hi.

You're talking.

Uh-huh.

What are you doing here, Laurie?

I know I don't have any right to be here... to bother you.

And I know you have every right to move on and I respect your boundaries, but I just... I need to talk to Tommy.

Nora told me that he wasn't here and I understand why she felt the need to say that.

I... I don't know what he told you, but if you could please just have him come see me.

I'm staying at the Prairie Motor Inn in Laramie, room 114.

When'd you talk to Nora?

Last night.

She didn't tell you?

Tommy's not here.

I haven't spoken to him in...

I haven't seen him in over a year.

He's not here?

No.

Why would you even think that he would come to me?

I don't know. I mean, he's in touch with Jill and I thought maybe...

He's not in touch with Jill.

He's in touch with Jill, Kevin.

They text all the time.

So Tommy, he's been with you?

Yeah.

Is he okay?

He's fine.

What did you do?

What happened?

Why are you here? What did you do, Laurie?

Are you okay, Kevin?

Yeah, I'm okay.

I'm gr I'm terrific.

I'm sorry.

I shouldn't have come here.

I'm... I'm sorry.

No, no.

No, you don't leave.

You're gonna leave?

You don't leave!

Hey, Laurie, fine. Good.

Good, go home.

Go home! Go home!

Kevin.

Hey, man.

You got the flier?

The what?

Oh, well, there was a palm print found on the car that the girls disappeared from.

Figured I'd give all the innocent men an opportunity to get on the right list.

But you're not here for that.

Oh, um... actually, I was...

I was hoping you might be able to help me out with this.

Oh. Your idea or Nora's?

It's hers.

Ooh.

Yeah.

Well, your secret is safe with me.

Good.

Cedric, go grab the cutters.

You know where they are?

Somewhere.

While you're here, you mind?

Me?

Yeah, you.

Oh, yeah.

Just press it down right there in the ink.

Your other hand.

Oh.

There we go.

HandiWipes are free.

Man: Your name?

Kevin Garvey.

Good.

Another innocent man exonerated.

Thanks for doing that, Kevin.

You're welcome.

No cutters, man. Couldn't find them.

T.J. must have taken them home with him.

John: Why would he do that?

Sorry, man. But... oh, you know who can help you out?

Locksmith right down on Fuller there.

Nate. Tell him I sent you.

Good. Thanks.

Yeah.

Patti: Well, that's that.

You went there to get free and you got caught.

You know, the only time in my life that I felt truly free, Kevin, was when I picked up that piece of glass and I stuck it in my neck.

You were holding me in your arms and I looked up into your eyes and you were so afraid.

But I wasn't.

Because it was finally over.

That's freedom.

Did you fix it?

She's not returning my calls.

You gonna tell me what you did?

It's complicated.

I'll bet it's not.

Are you pretending?

Pretending what?

I believed you when you said that you loved Nora.

And you said that you wanted to adopt Lily.

And you said you wanted us all to be a family.

That's all I want.

Then what are you going to do, Dad?

I don't know.

Please figure it out.

I know.

This is twice now, so...

[door opens, closes]

[knocks]

[knocks]

Kevin, I know.

I'm gonna leave first thing in the morning.

I promise. You didn't need to...

Can we talk?

What?

Can I talk to you?

Okay.

What is she wearing?

What?

Patti.

When you see her, what is she wearing?

She's wearing white.

The same thing as when she died?

I don't know. It's just white.

Huh.

Can I get one of those?

Yeah.

Where did you hide them?

What?

Your cigarettes.

When we were married, where did you hide them?

Oh... in the trunk of my car.

I also stuck a pack under the mailbox for when I went on runs.

It's f*cking great smoking.

[chuckles] Yeah.

So what kinds of things does she say to you?

Well, she told me not to tell Nora about her.

'Cause Nora would leave.

Yeah.

And she was right.

Yeah, I guess she was.

And now that Nora's gone, what kinds of things does Patti say?

Nothing.

Nothing?

No.

Kevin, a few hours ago, you were yelling at me to go home and now we're here.

Is she telling you to do something?

Something you don't want to do?

I'm assuming she's not here right now.

No.

And she wasn't at the gate when you saw me earlier?

No, she...

Well, that makes sense.

It does?

Uh-huh.

She'd want to stay as far away from me as possible.

Why?

Because I can prove she doesn't exist.

How?

I could ask you to make her tell you something that only she and I would know and she wouldn't be able to do it.

But she tells me things all the time I wasn't there for.

She told me about her husband.

Neil?

Neil, yeah.

Kevin, I was Patti's therapist for over three years.

I mean, don't report me for breaking confidentiality, but I told you about Neil.

The serial philanderer with the a**l fixation.

Highly abusive. Probably the reason she started fixating on the end of the world.

I...

I don't remember any of that.

Well, maybe if you listened to me more, we wouldn't be in this fix, huh?

It's a... it's a joke.

It's a joke.

Well, if you were my patient walking into my office, I would indulge this.

You never tell somebody who's in the midst of a psychotic break that they are in the midst of a psychotic break.

But you are not my patient, so I'm gonna tell you the truth.

What you are seeing is not real.

I know your dad struggled with this as well.

And there is research indicating that there is a genetic link...

She's there.

She's right there.

She's real.

You believe that?

Yes.

Can I tell you about belief, Kevin?

When the mind is in emotional distress, it will grasp at any construct that makes it feel better.

After the 14th, the whole world needed to feel better.

We were all in emotional distress.

So that made all of us susceptible to false belief, to be taken advantage of.

And the reason I know this, Kevin, is because Tommy and I use it.

We convince people that he could take their pain away just by hugging them.

We had a story.

We made it up, but it worked.

And... I mean, Tommy hated it, the lying.

And I said it didn't matter as long as we were helping people.

But he disagreed.

And we had a f*ght and he said that he couldn't...

What I am trying to say... is that they believed it.

Every single person that he laid his hands on.

Because their brains would sooner embrace magic than deal with feelings of fear and abandonment and guilt.

And all of us turn to someone who could just turn it off.

Why do you think I joined a f*cking cult?

And now you are manifesting the leader of that cult because you need someone to turn it off.

There is no Patti, Kevin.

There is only you.

So what do I do?

You need to go on medication and maybe go away for a little while.

What you're dealing with is very serious, Kevin.

And I know it's scary, but that's what you need to do.

You need help.

Did you change your last name?

What?

Is your last name still Garvey?

Or did you change it when we split up?

No, I didn't change it.

Then I can get you a wristband.

Kevin, I don't understand.

Will you come with me?

If you're there, then she'll leave me alone.

You know, just till I figure it out.

I don't think that's a good idea.

I don't think Jill's gonna want to see me.

I didn't want to see you.

I'm getting over that.

You said I need help, so... help.

Jill?

Jill, honey.

She's not home.

Her boyfriend lives next door.

She's probably with him.

Come on in.

Our guest bedroom's in there if you don't mind sleeping in a hospital bed.

Mary Jamison's been staying with us.

Mary? Matt's wife?

Yeah.

Long story.

I'm sorry about the dog.

What?

You wanted to get a dog, a puppy.

I was kind of a dick about it.

I forgot that.

I think about that a lot.

Well, consider yourself forgiven.

[phone ringing]

It's Nora.

Go, take it. I'm fine.

Okay. Hi.

How are you? How's Lily?

Nora: Please stop calling me.

Can you tell me where you are?

No.

Why not?

Please, just tell me where you are.

Can we talk about this?

Hello?

I don't want to talk about you seeing a dead woman.

I know. I know it's...

I know... I know I should have told you sooner when it started like we promised each other, but I was scared you were gonna run.

And you did.

And you also handcuffed me to a bed and you didn't even leave me with a key.

There was a sign.

A what?

I left it on the chair by the bed.

It's not there?

She was blocking it.

Oh.

Nora.

I love you.

Listen, there's a way.

I have a way.

A way that I can get better.

But I need to know that you'd believe me if I looked you in the eye and I told you that she was gone.

That you'd know that she was.

How?

It doesn't matter.

I can.

I just need to know that when I do that you'd believe me.

Because I would never lie to you.

Never.

Would you believe me?

I would believe you.

And would you come back?

I'd like that.

What are you doing here?

Well, honey, your father... I'm here to...

Where is he?

He's upstairs.

Dad!

Jill.

Jill. Jill.

Hey, Dad!

What the f*ck is she doing here?

Dad!

Dad?

[engine starts]

[tires squeal]

Dad!

Dad!

[indistinct chatter]

[knocks]

What's going on?

Oh, nothing, nothing.

Michael was... Michael was just leaving.

God be with you.

How do we do this?

You just tell me you're ready.

I'm ready.

That should do it.

What is that?

It's poison.

It's gonna stop your heart.

You said temporarily.

That I did. That I did.

This... epinephrine.

That poison's gonna work like a heroin overdose.

It's gonna shut you down.

This is gonna start you back up.

Now, I'm gonna time this.

Brain will be fine for up to five minutes.

I'll give you the sh*t long before that.

You've done this before?

You know the guy on the pillar?

Yeah.

His name's Edward.

He's a living, breathing success story.

Just so you know... this is...

I don't want to die.

Of course not.

Life is precious.

[exhales]

I just drink it?

Just drink it.

Patti: Wait!

She here?

[laughs]

I'm...

I'm glad you're finally taking action, Kevin, but let's think about this for a second.

This is a big step for us.

And we don't really know him.

If I'm understanding right, his primary qualification is that he's a pedophile.

Shut the f*ck up, Patti.

Do you want me to do this?

What?

Do you want me to do this?

Or don't you?

I absolutely want you to do it.

What? What? What did she say?

Laurie just told me I was a psychotic.

That I belonged in a mental hospital like my dad.

That was his diagnosis, too.

Psychotic.

I saw him right before I came here and he told me the voices were gone, that he was cured.

And I asked him how.

You know what he told me, Patti?

He said he finally just did what they told him to do.

Kevin, stop!

Good-bye, Patti.

How long does this usually take to...

[gasping]

I'm sorry, son. I know it hurts.

But it won't be long now.

Who are you?

Gracias.

[beeps]

Hey!

[doorbell rings]

Nora Durst?

Yes.

Hello, my name is Dr. Joaquin Cuarto.

May I speak to you for a few minutes?

About what?

Um, may I ask when you moved into this house?

What?

Um, the records say you purchased it on the 21st.

But when did you actually take residence, On the 21st or on the 22nd?

I don't remember. Why are you asking me that?

The girl next door disappeared on the 22nd.

Um, is that the day you moved in?

Did you make contact with her?

What?

Evangeline Murphy.

[beeps]

Did you touch her at all on that day?

[equipment beeping]

What is that thing?

May I ask were you in physical contact

With your husband and your children on October the 14th At the moment of their departure?

Get the f*ck off my porch.

This will just take a minute. If you'll just hold still.

Get off my porch.

Please don't... Just hold still.

Get out of here!

I'm just trying to help you.

Erika: You okay?

I'm fine.

Good morning, Mary.

Hope you slept better than I did.

Would you like to visit Matt today?

You must miss him, huh?

[whirring]

[phone chiming]

Hello?

Woman: Hello.

Is this Nora Durst?

Yes.

Miss Durst, my name is Dr. Allison Hebert.

How are you this morning?

I'm fine.

I believe my colleague Dr. Cuarto Paid you a visit yesterday.

Miss Durst?

Please don't call this number.

Morning.

Morning.

You okay?

I'm just tired. I didn't sleep great.

Go back to bed. I can feed Mary.

You sure?

Go. Sleep.

[music playing]

[grunts]

Is the baby awake?

Not yet.

Okay.

[clanks]

Uncuff me?

Maybe in a minute.

If you cooperate.

[chuckles]

And if I don't?

Then you will pay.

Mm-hmm.

[gasps]

What? Did I hurt you?

No, I just got a cramp in my leg.

[baby crying]

[sighs]

Shit.

[muted] Babe.

[muted] Somebody threw a rock through our window.

[high-pitched whine]

What?

Somebody threw a rock through our window.

You slept through it?

Uh, yeah.

Yeah.

What do you think this is about?

What do you think this is about?

Wait, babe, where you going?

To get a broom and dustpan.

[doorbell rings]

Erika: Who is it?

It's him again.

Mr. Murphy, can I speak to you for one moment?

Don't answer it.

Oh, baby.

[phone chiming]

Morning.

Can I ask you a question?

Is there a place...

Who are you?

Sorry?

Who are you?

Oh, uh, George brevity.

I'm with the DSD, The department of sudden departure.

Nora durst, northeast division.

I'm on leave.

Small world, huh?

What branch?

Benefits. You?

Secondaries.

Oh, of course.

Do you know them? The Murphys?

Not well. We just moved in.

Lucky you.

Lucky me?

I mean, it's hard to find a place here, You know, since we verified.

What did you want to ask me?

Oh, is there a good place to get breakfast?

The tourist stuff is getting old.

Try Smitty's. There's no sign outside.

There's a green awning across from the guy on the pillar.

Smitty's. Thanks.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

[door opens]

Excuse me, Mrs. Murphy.

Can I talk to you for a minute? Mrs. Murphy.

Could I just talk with you a moment?

Mrs. Murphy.

Poor woman, huh?

It's horrible.

[car engine starts]

Erika.

Loretta. Emily.

We need you to talk john into talking to the DSD.

John isn't the one that doesn't want to talk to them, I am.

Why not?

We've talked to the police, we've talked to the FBI.

And they're the ones that are looking for our girls.

But they haven't found them.

The man from the DSD said that he could rule out...

Rule out what?

What questions did he ask that we haven't already been asked?

We're not supposed to say.

We signed a... nondisclosure agreement.

What are y'all wearing tonight?

To the fundraiser.

I'm wearing whatever I want.

Okay, well, then I'll see you tonight.

Emily, you smell like alcohol.

[faint music playing]

[chatter]

[cash register rings]

Woman: Order up.

Hey, you found it.

Yeah, the promised land. [chuckles]

Mind if I sit with you for a sec? I ordered some carryout.

Be my guest.

Forget the water.

This brisket's the miracle.

Mmm, barbecue is a religious experience down here.

You're not from Texas?

DC.

Oh, I thought they'd send someone from regional.

You're living in the only municipality With a population above 5,000 with no deeps.

Three girls lifted from here? They're not calling regional.

But they're gonna rule it unconfirmed, right?

Not gonna rule anything till your neighbors talk to me.

I administered the new questionnaire to the parents of the other girls.

None of the fraud flags popped.

There's a new questionnaire?

Uh-huh.

The algorithm came from the Japanese.

Getting some interesting results.

Can I see it?

You kidding me? They'd fire me.

They want me to sleep with this thing under my pillow.

I mean, if the questions got corrupted, There'd be no way to confirm the secondary is the real deal.

Mm, the real deal.

The girl's Mercedes was found running Like a foot just disappeared off the gas pedal.

Music still blasting.

All the personal effects are still inside the car.

Purses, phones.

No sign of any kind of struggle whatsoever.

No reason to run.

Everybody I've talked to around here says these are good girls.

Choir girls.

Three weeks gone and there's not a single sighting of them anywhere.

If the questionnaire says they lifted, Maybe they lifted.

[sighs]

Can I ask you something stupid?

My favorite kind of question.

Have you ever heard of someone Being responsible for another person's departure?

You mean the lensing thing?

Lensing?

You know, like a lens.

Like a kid taking a magnifying glass and frying ants with it.

The idea is that someone gives off Ultraviolet rays or whatnot Causing everyone around them to lift.

It was in that ""scientific American"" article they emailed us last month.

Can you forward that to me?

Dr. Murphy?

Mm.

We need you in exam three.

Can somebody else take it?

It should probably be you.

I didn't do anything wrong.

I was just selling water.

How much?

Just a couple of bottles.

How much are you selling it for?

500 a milliliter.

The samples I took from the spring that drained are genuine, So if people are willing to pay that much, Then what did I do wrong?

Want to let me take a look at your hand?

Yeah.

They took my palm print.

Why would they do that?

Can you make a fist?

[winces]

I want a copy of your report.

The rangers want a list of my injuries when I go in to describe my attackers.

One of them black, 40, clean-cut?

He's the one that hit you the hardest?

Yeah.

That's john Murphy.

Maybe you let him slide just this once.

Why would I do that?

Because I have plans tonight and I don't want to miss them Because I'm back in here fixing you up again.

Let me get you some ice.

[baby cooing]

Hey.

What are you doing out here, miss lily?

Oh, let's get out of there.

Oh, oh, okay.

Hey.

Aw.

Nora: ""researchers found themselves intrigued By the anomalous phenomenon of the departure cluster, The most extreme example of which is the notorious Brandenburg carousel.""

They never confirmed that f*cking carousel.

Some genius in German tourism cooked it up.

[doorbell rings]

Lily?

She was on the hood of the truck.

Oh, my God.

Oh, Kevin was watching her. I thought she was down for a nap.

No worries.

When Evie was five years old, I thought she was playing in the backyard.

I had no idea she was gone until her friend's mom called And asked when was I gonna pick her up.

My daughter Erin did that same thing when she was four.

Oh, I didn't know you had another daughter.

I used to, but she's gone now.

My son, too.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Well, thank you again.

[music playing]

Kevin: Don't tell me how to f*cking do it.

I know how to strip f*cking...

It's wallpaper.

Well, then don't f*cking tell me.

Who are you talking to?

Myself.

Oh, shit.

I took her to the hardware store and I had all that shit to carry And then I... I forgot to go back out and get her.

I am so sorry.

Kevin. Kevin.

It's okay. It happens.

It's okay.

I'm sorry.

It's okay.

I'm so sorry.

You should hop in the shower.

I'm gonna take Mary to visit Matt And then I'll meet you at the visitors' center for the fundraiser.

Yeah.

Wait, what?

The fundraiser.

For the Murphys and the other missing girls.

We're going to that?

Why wouldn't we?

Because we asked them for help and they f*cking banished your brother.

Matt banished himself.

And people aren't at their best when they're in that kind of pain.

We should support them. That's what neighbors do.

[steam hisses]

Oh, shit. f*ck.

[hissing stops]

f*ck.

Have you seen my batteries?

Huh?

The batteries for my ears.

They're not in the kitchen drawer.

You want me to run out to the pharmacy?

No, I have some upstairs.

You think this is on me?

What?

People throwing rocks through our window.

You think it's because of what I do?

That man that you b*at the shit out of this morning, He thinks it's because he was selling our water.

No, he was selling lies.

Then why'd you take his palm print?

Because I seem to recall there being one left On the car that our daughter disappeared from.

Let's just call this what it is.

What is it?

You need to hit people because you need to hit people.

I'm trying.

I know, babe.

[soft chatter]

SPF 75? What a joke.

Anything over 30 is basically useless.

[door opens]

Hey.

Hey.

We're going to visit Matt.

Do you want to come to the fundraiser with us or go with your dad?

Actually, Michael asked me.

How do his parents feel about that?

I don't think that he asked them.

And I'm not really asking you either.

Well, if you were, I'd say he's a sweet guy And I'm happy for you.

Thanks.

All right, I'll see you there?

See you there.

[phone chiming]

Hello.

Hebert: Miss Durst, please don't hang up. It's Allison Hebert again.

If I could have one moment, please?

What do you want?

I need to apologize for my colleague Dr. Cuarto.

He's a great scientist, but he lacks people skills.

He should not have come to your home To collect the data from you without permission.

Data?

Yes.

I must say the measurements he took were very promising. Very.

If you'd allow us, we could guarantee their accuracy By replicating them in laboratory conditions.

You think I'm a lens?

You're familiar with this theory?

Not really. I don't...

I just read an article.

Miss Durst, you moved to Jarden, a town with no departures, And that very night three girls disappeared, One of whom lived next door to you.

Yes, we believe you are a lens.

Why? Do you know why me?

Well, this is where our research is, um...

Divisive.

I would like very much to discuss this in person.

Please just tell me.

Miss durst, we believe that the demon Azrael has chosen you as his earthbound instrument.

This entity resides in you through no fault of your own and is responsible for the chaos that surrounds you and possibly many others.

Dr. Cuarto and I have contacted the Vatican...

[clicks]

[laughing]

[crying]

[high-pitched whine]

[audio muted]

[muted] Hey!

Hey!

[tires screech]

[horn honks]

Why'd you run?

I was just dropping off...

Wait, wait, wait. Say it again and say it slow.

[muted speech]

[high-pitched whine]

[faint music playing]

[humming]

What the f*ck is this?

That's a pie.

Why'd you send it to my house?

Well, 'cause I know you're in pain.

John got a pie on his birthday.

We weren't in pain then.

You weren't?

Is this about Michael coming to pray with me?

What?

Oh, he didn't tell you.

I'm not gonna say this again.

Stay away from my family.

I know what I did.

And I know I can never make it right.

And I also know that you wish it wasn't so, But I am your family, Erika.

You want to take a bird with you?

Why the f*ck would I do that?

[engine starts]

[chatter]

[drums playing]

Hey.

I come bearing gifts.

Hey!

Thanks.

Yummy.

Hey.

Hey.

That was for you.

No, we share everything here.

Hup.

Hello, my love.

I'm sorry you have to come out here again.

Not all the people are degenerates.

So this is, what, your new congregation?

Nah, just a bunch of folks who needed a little guidance.

And all you had to do to win their respect was humiliate yourself in the stocks.

No, all I had to do was refuse to let someone else take my place.

Suffering breeds compassion.

Nobody does it like you, Matt.

[chuckles]

Matt: You clean the tube every night?

Of course. And we got the bed like you had back in Mapleton.

They're expensive. You and Kevin didn't have to do that.

It's fine. We rented it.

The OB appointment is this Friday, So we'll pick you up on the way out of town.

I bet you're looking forward to that, huh?

Get our first peek.

Hear the b*at.

Any sign of her...

Waking up?

No, Matt.

Give her time.

You look nice.

Going somewhere special?

Oh, we're going to the fundraiser for the families of the missing girls.

They need money to continue the search, so...

What?

You bringing Mary?

Yeah, we're going straight from here.

Hmm.

What, Matt?

The Murphys don't believe what happened to her. They deny it.

You bringing her to their party may be regarded as hostile.

They lost their daughter.

Why would I feel hostile towards them?

I don't know. Why would you?

f*ck you, Matt.

♪ Don't rearrange me ♪
♪ Don't ever let me come down ♪

Let me help you with that.

I got it.

Thank you.

She loved that on you.

I think she just wanted you to give it to her, but you never took the hint.

I took the hint.

Just wanted it for myself.

Michael.

I'm in here.

You gonna get dressed?

Yeah, just a minute.

[sighs]

I know you go out there to pray with him.

Who?

Don't make me say his name.

Do you know what your father would do if he found out?

sh**t him again?

Michael, you can't go out there anymore.

He deserves forgiveness.

No, not him.

Everyone who asks for it deserves it, Mom.

Even him.

Michael, go get dressed.

But again, thank you.

[quiet chatter]

[phone chiming]

Listen to me, if you call this number again, I will report you to the f*cking police.

Do you understand me?

Laurie: Is this Nora?

Who is this?

It's Laurie Garvey.

Nora, are you there?

How did you get this number?

On the internet.

It's really easy to unlist if you want.

I'm sorry to call you. I know it's not fair, but I just need to know, is Tom there?

Tom?

My son, Tommy.

Is he there with you in Texas?

No, he's not here. I've never even met him.

Is something wrong?

Well, if you do see him, if he comes there, will you tell him that I'm worried about him?

Can you tell him I'm sorry?

Okay, I'll do that.

All right. Thanks, Nora.

Good-bye.

Bye.

Hey, how was Matt?

Fine.

You okay?

Yeah, let's go sit.

Woman: Hi there.

We're taking donations for the reward fund and for the families to hire out-of-state resources for the search.

Oh, yes, of course. We'd like to give 500, please.

That's very generous. Do you have a Paypal account?

Sorry?

A Paypal account.

That's how we do the donations.

If you don't have one, I can set one up for you.

No, I have one.

Then you know the drill.

There you go.

[faint music playing]

Let's grab those seats up there.

Sure.

Excuse me.

Evening.

Oh, hey there.

Oh, Kevin, this is...

I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

George Brevity, DSD.

Oh, did you guys work together or...?

Mm-mmm.

I sent you that article. Did you get it?

Yeah, it was horseshit.

Really?

Our research guys thought there was some pretty interesting stuff there.

They're working some of that data into the new questionnaire.

Okay, if everybody could just take their seats.

Excuse me. I've got to record this.

Okay.

We're gonna go ahead and get started.

Thank you.

[goat bleating]

[bleating]

Uh-uh. Uh-uh, no.

No.

No. How do I stop this?

[music stops]

Jerry, uh-uh, no.

You got to get out of here.

[crowd murmuring]

Woman: Let him do it.

No, Jerry.

Come on, let him do it.

He's trying to help.

He's trying to help? This man is crazy.

He k*ll a goat on October 14

Before any of us knew what happened and he was locked up in jail where he should have stayed.

But then all y'all decided that Jerry must have saved us, that Jerry knew something.

He sacrificed something to protect us.

So now he's a holy man and he gets to walk around here

k*ll goats whenever he feels like it just in case?

John: Babe, can you calm down, please?

No, you let him do it, too.

If there aren't any miracles in Miracle, then why does he get a pass?

Cecilia, you were trying on your wedding dress when it happened, huh?

So now you put it on every day and you take pictures with the tourists, huh?

Number 13 on the audio tour.

Well, maybe you were the one that saved us.

Maybe, huh?

We are the 9,261 and we are spared.

We're spared.

We're not spared.

We're not safe.

All this shit we're walking around here doing, it doesn't matter.

It doesn't work. My daughter is gone.

So no. No, Jerry.

She departed.

[doors slam]

See you at home.

Where are you going?

Man: Okay, folks, everybody just stay seated.

Everything's gonna be fine.

[knocks]

Hi.

Hi.

I was at the fundraiser. Are you okay?

I'm fine.

Here.

It's the questions the DSD wants to ask you.

Where did you get it?

I borrowed it.

That man, the agent isn't going to leave you alone.

I wanted you to have it so you could see there's nothing to be scared of.

I'm scared?

Yes.

Of what?

You're scared that if you answer these questions, everyone's gonna know that your daughter didn't depart.

She didn't?

And those questions will prove it?

Well, come on in and ask them.

Did the missing person bite or chew his or her fingernails?

No.

Did the missing person recently commence new dietary habits including but not restricted to vegan, gluten-free or paleolithic?

No.

Would you describe the missing person as generous?

Yes.

Would you describe yourself as generous?

Generous people don't describe themselves as generous.

So no?

No.

To your knowledge, did the missing person consume one or more alcoholic beverages per day?

No.

Do you consume one or more alcoholic beverages per day?

No.

Did the missing person use aluminum-based antiperspirant?

She uses secret.

It's aluminum-based.

Is the missing person a product of a multiple birth?

Yes, Evie and Michael are twins.

Did the missing person have visual impairment or wear corrective... lenses?

Yes.

Was the missing person diagnosed with any neurological conditions Such as essential tremor, Tourette's syndrome or any disorder that manifested seizures?

She has epilepsy.

She had a seizure the night she disappeared.

You were there.

Yeah, I remember.

How often on average did you dream about the missing person prior to their disappearance?

I don't know.

Three or four times a month.

How often on average do you dream about them now?

Every night.

To the best of your recollection, what were the last words the missing person spoke to you?

[sighs]

I don't remember.

You don't remember?

No.

To the best of your knowledge, did the missing person ever express a desire to hurt him or herself? If so, why?

Absolutely not.

Have you ever expressed a desire to hurt yourself? If so, why?

No.

To the best of your knowledge, did the missing person withdraw more than $1,000 from his or her bank within 30 days prior to their disappearance? If so, what for?

Evie's account is connected to ours.

She didn't withdraw any money.

Did you withdraw more than $1,000 from your bank within 30 days prior to the disappearance?

If so, what for?

Yes.

If so, what for?

[clock ticking faintly]

I was gonna leave John.

You're surprised because we seem so happy.

My Grandmother was born here.

She lived here all her life.

She used to tell us kids this place is chosen.

The Good Lord pointed His finger down on the final day of creation And said: ""You. The Jarden of Eden.""

We didn't believe her, but she said there was a way to prove it, a way to make your wishes come true.

You take a bird, you put it in a box and you bury it.

Anywhere in the woods is fine.

And you wait.

You wait three days, you come back, dig it up, and if it's alive, right then is when you make your wish.

Little girls believe all sorts of things, but I knew pretend when I heard it.

Birds living in the ground for three days is pretend.

Making wishes is pretend.

The Good Lord is pretend.

And then on October 14, people went away from everywhere except here.

That was real.

That happened.

My Grandma had been dead for 10 years, but she was right.

This place was chosen.

And about a month ago, I was walking out to my car and...

I saw it.

A sparrow right by the driver's side door lying there like it was trying to get me to help it.

It was dehydrated.

Almost dead.

You think I nursed it back to health, Nora?

Depending on the size of the box, a bird can survive 20 hours.

Anything over 30 hours is medically impossible.

And like I said, this bird, it didn't have anything left.

So I waited the three days.

I jogged out to the woods, I dug up the box, and I made my wish before I opened it.

I wished that my kids would be okay if I left.

Because they had no idea I needed to go.

No idea what it's like to pretend.

Michael, he has his faith.

He'd be fine.

But Evie...

She wouldn't understand.

It would break her heart.

So I wished that she'd be okay without me.

I opened up the box, the bird flew out.

And the next night my daughter was gone.

Well, Erika, that's just...

That's quite a stretch.

Your logic, I'm sorry, it's a little all over the place, don't you think?

Well, what do you think?

You wanted to leave your husband.

Okay, so why didn't he go? Why didn't you?

140 million people disappeared three years ago.

Did you wish them away, too?

Because that's a lot of birds to bury, Erika.

That's a flock of epic proportions.

I get it. I felt the same as you.

I... [sighs] I felt responsible for losing my children.

I thought it was my fault.

But I moved past it.

I evolved.

Because that's pathetic.

Terrible things happen in this world.

And the only comfort we get is that we didn't cause them.

So I'm sorry, but...

Erika, this had nothing to do with you.

Did they depart or did they die?

What?

Your children.

You said you lost them.

Did they depart or did they die?

They departed.

What were the last words they said to you, to the best of your recollection?

[papers shuffle]

[door opens]

[door closes]

[sniffling]

Hey.

Hey.

Mary's asleep.

Jill's putting the baby down upstairs.

Okay, I'll go up and help out.

We need to talk.

Can we do this tomorrow?

It's important.

Yes, honey, I know it's important, but can we just...

I need to talk to you now, Nora.

Have you been noticing that I've been... kind of losing my mind?

What?

I'm letting you handcuff me to the bed every night And we're acting like that's totally normal.

I left the baby... I forgot the baby and you act like that's no big deal.

You had your hands full. It happens.

I'm seeing someone.

What?

Um, I've been...

Seeing someone.

Who?

Patti Levin.

She ran the Guilty Remnant in Mapleton.

But she's dead.

It started happening right after we found Lily when you moved in.

I thought she'd go away when we came here.

She didn't.

Are you seeing her right now?

Yeah.

Is she talking to you?

Yeah.

What's she saying?

She's saying...

She's saying I never should have told you about her.

And...

That I just made a big mistake.

Good night. I love you.

[sighs]

Mary?

Mary, please look at me.

I don't get--

I can't understand why you came back and went away again.

Why would you?

I'm doing it all exactly the same way it was that day.

The same song, the same places-- the church, the supermarket-- the same fruit in your shake, the same burrito, but it isn't working.

I know it was this place.

It was the first night we were here and I know it was this place because you woke up, Mary.

We spoke.

And we laughed.

And we...

For three hours you were awake and I don't know why you went back to sleep.

Is it a test?

Can you look at me?

Just give a small sign that you're here.

Oh, this isn't fair.

You can't give that to me and take it away again.

So you-- you need to look at me now, Mary, okay?

Look at me.

Look at me!

We'll let you all through in five minutes.

Please pull over to the waiting area.

Excuse-- excuse me, sir.

My wife has an appointment. We need to--

We'll let you go as soon as we can, sir.

Ranger: Please pull over. Visitors coming through.

[ranger radio chatter]

[whistle blowing]

Please pull over. Visitors coming through.

Think they could invest in a bigger bridge, huh?

Ranger #2: Come on in.

Ranger: Visitors coming through.

That's true, Matt, but then the town would lose its authenticity.

[alarm blaring]

[whistle blowing]

What's happening?

Get back in your car, sir.

Can I--

We have runners. We have runners.

Go, baby, go!

[stun g*n crackling]

Hey!

[groaning]

[groaning, struggling continue]

[horns honking]

Tech: Any allergies?

No allergies, but she has an adverse reaction to amoxicillin.

And the reason for the scan?

I was hoping to find out if there's been any improvement in brain function.

Anything in her behavior to suggest a change?

Um, I'd just like to compare her results to her last scan, please.

You can send them to our doctor in New York.

You got it.

Can you tell me how much the co-pay is?

You'd have to talk to billing.

Will she feel it?

I don't know.

[machine knocking]

Sir, personnel only once the scan starts.

Someone will come get you when she's through.

Yeah, okay.

[sighs] f*ck!

[door opens]

Mr. Jamison!

Would you mind coming back inside?

Why?

We'd like to discuss the results.

I told you to send the results to our doctor.

I'm not paying for any more--

There's no charge, sir.

But if you could please just come on back in.

It's important.

[door opens]

Mr. Jamison.

Charlie Sampson. How are y'all today?

I'm good, thanks.

Sorry, are you a doctor?

No, sir, I am not.

If you wouldn't mind taking a look at this and signing it, y'all can be on your way.

Waiver of liability?

I don't... Sorry, I don't... they said this was about Mary's results.

Is there a problem?

Yes, sir, there is.

You failed to disclose your wife's condition.

If you had, we would have never administered the contrast dye.

I told you about her condition.

I answered all the nurse's questions.

You told us she was in a persistent vegetative state.

You did not tell us that she was pregnant.

Our blood draw showed HCG levels well over 1,000.

We couldn't have children.

I never thought that-- you're pregnant?

Well, congratulations.

Now if you'll please just sign the release.

What is this?

It indemnifies the imaging center in the event that the pregnancy is no longer viable.

Why wouldn't it be viable?

Because your wife is a 40-year-old woman in what amounts to a coma.

You're looking at close to a 90% chance of her miscarrying.

That's why we ask for consent before we administer an MRI.

But our tech did not ask for it in this case, sir, because your wife is not capable of giving consent.

And if she's not capable of giving her consent for a test, she cannot give her consent for anything.

You take my meaning?

No.

She was awake.

She was awake when we--

I would never do that.

Of course you wouldn't.

Just like you wouldn't want to have to say that under oath if you didn't have to.

Now please sign the release.

I want my co-pay back.

[Matt laughs] I knew it!

10 years we tried. 10 years and nothing.

And in one night... one night!

It's that place.

That's why you woke up, isn't it?

So this could happen.

Don't you worry about that 90% business.

Once we're back across that bridge, you'll be fine.

You and the baby.

You and the baby.

Oh, poor guy.

[blinker ticking]

Hey there. You okay?

I've been better.

Anything I can do to help?

Yeah. Just conked out on me.

I think it might be the radiator.

Well, I tried to call for a tow, but there's no reception out here.

Well, let me try.

Dropped it in the toilet.

I've lost two that way.

Well, we're just a couple of miles out of town.

I can give you a ride.

Is that your wristband?

You live there?

In Miracle?

Yes.

Me and my wife Mary.

She okay?

Getting better all the time.

Oh, hey.

What's your name?

Is that your son? [groans]

I'm sorry.

[groans]

We-we have to get in. Get his wristband, son.

Man: Careful, don't rip it.

I can't get it off.

Stand over here, God damn it.

[screaming]

We have to get in.

[Matt groans]

All right, come on. Door, get in.

Woman: Matt.

Matt, we have to hurry.

You have to get us back in.

Mary?

He won't last out here.

[groans] I'm gonna lose the baby, Matt.

Please, honey.

Get us back in.

I will.

[winces]

Mary?

It's okay, honey.

I heard you.

We'll go right now.

No.

No!

Almost home, sweetheart.

[ranger radio chatter]

Hello. Excuse me.

This access is for park personnel only.

I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to return to camp.

We live in the park. We were attacked, me and my wife.

A man and his son, they were in a red car.

Would you like to report this to the local sheriff's office, sir?

I'd like to report it to you.

Sorry, but we got no jurisdiction if you're not in the park.

We live in the park. Please just let us in so I can get my wife home.

The longer she's...

I cannot let you cross without a valid ID, reservation, or a wristband.

They stole our wristbands.

[sighs] We live on Scarborough Street.

I work at the Sacred Mission with Reverend Massey.

We shop at the Safeway on Amarillo.

We attend the Jarden Community Pool every Sunday and Wednesday.

My sister just moved here, but I haven't memorized her number and my phone fell in a toilet.

Please.

We live here.

Y'all need to go to the visitors' center, get yourselves some replacement bands, okay?

Yes, sir.

Yeah, thank you.

[chain rattles]

God bless you.

He does every day.

Recording: The visitor wristband is your ticket into Miracle.

Visitors must wear their wristband at all times.

Spell your name again for me.

J-A-M-I-S-O-N.

Is this gonna take much longer? We got a wedding in town.

You said it was a sanctuary pass?

Yes, Reverend Massey sponsored us of Sacred Mission.

My sister just moved here. Could she sponsor us?

What's her name?

Nora Durst.

Durst.

Excuse me. Can you help us?

Could you just wait a minute?

[line ringing]

May I?

Kevin: Hello?

Kevin?

Oh, thank God. Um, Mary and I-- they won't let us back into town.

We're at the visitors' center.

Our wristbands were stolen...

Jesus Christ, man. Step aside.

...and now they won't give us any new ones.

I'm on the phone.

I don't care.

Sir, unless they've been here for six months, I can't help you.

Now, you hear that? She can't help you. Now step aside, man.

Please, will you mind your own business?

No, I did my business. I've got my documents.

And you don't. So why don't you just roll her on out of here 'cause she doesn't look like she's in a rush to get anywhere.

Oh, you've got your documents.

That's right.

You've got your documents.

Yes.

[papers crunch]

Let's see them, huh?

Recording: Welcome to Miracle National Park...

She pretending?

No, she's not pretending.

He will die.

What?

She says if you don't get her back inside, he will die.

Who?

[door opens]

Ranger: Matt and Mary Jamison.

Jesus, Matt. Are you okay?

Yeah.

Thank you.

You zip-tied him?

Man got a busted hand. Works at the church.

What, you scared he gonna baptize you or something?

Give me the clippers.

This is John. He's gonna help you and Mary.

Yes, we met.

Mm-hmm.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

You should get it looked at in case it needs to be set.

Erika will take care of him once we get back into town.

My wife's a doctor.

I'll be fine. Thank you.

I'm sorry about your daughter.

I've been handing out fliers at the church.

Appreciate it.

Try to keep it elevated.

I always do.

I wish I could say this never happens, but every man for himself out there.

It can get rough.

What were y'all doing in Austin?

Just getting a test, a scan for Mary.

Everything okay?

Yes, thank you.

We do it every six months or so to see if there's been any change in her condition.

Was there?

Sorry?

Any change in her condition.

N-no.

Except for the pregnant part.

What?

You-- you went through Mary's bag?

It fell out. One of the rangers picked it up.

Matt, what's he talking about?

Please, this is very complicated.

It is complicated.

Yes, and we... They said the pregnancy is high risk, so the longer we're out here--

I need to get Mary back into town now.

John: Why?

What?

Why do you need to get Mary back into town now?

John, he's been attacked.

Yeah, and I'm trying to help, but I'm not getting the whole story.

Did she wake up?

You brought her here, all the way to Miracle, Texas, and she woke up, right?

And while she was awake, you made love.

And then, shit, she went right back to this.

That the story you gonna tell?

The only story you can tell?

'Cause it's not true.

Because that doesn't happen here.

People don't get healed.

My wife lost her hearing a long time ago and it's still lost.

So, what, God likes your wife better than mine?

Your friend Kevin here asked me to help you out.

I owe him, so I will.

But you got to tell me the truth.

The truth?

In about five months when your wife starts to show and everybody knows she's pregnant, you need to say that you were sad and lonely and confused.

And that you are very sorry for what you did because you knew it was wrong.

Jesus, John...

That's the truth.

Right?

Yes.

She never woke up.

She never woke up.

Okay.

Well, let's get you home.

What happened to you?

Excuse me?

I know your daughter is missing and that's terrible, I'm sorry, but you were like this before that.

You're angry at this place.

What happened to you?

You know what?

I don't think I'm gonna be able to get those wristbands after all.

Kevin: Hey, come on. Hey, John. Hey!

[door opens]


What the f*ck was that, Matt?

How much money do you have?

What?

I'm gonna need money. How much do you have?

Me and Nora are gonna talk...

Now, Kevin.

I need to get her back now.

Okay, okay.

I got that. Thank you.

Get her on the bridge.

Matt: I've got her.

Ranger: Coming through.

Matt: We'll be fine, Kevin.

[chains rattle]

[crowd chattering]

I'll get us back in.

You'll be fine.

You and the baby.

Matt: Excuse me, um...

Excuse me.

Excuse me, ladies.

I'm looking for a tall man with a samurai bun.

Excuse me, gentlemen...

Hey, what you looking at?

What?

Do you want to free him?

Man: Look over here!

Yes, of course.

Then take his place.

Crowd: Yeah! Go!

Get up there.

Yeah!

Yeah, I didn't think so.

[clamoring continues]

Woman: Yeah, get up there.

Hey!

[men grunting]

[blows thudding]

Y'all okay?

Yes, thanks.

I'm looking for a tall man with a samurai bun on his head.

Swedish guy?

Yes, I think so.

Name's Elmer or something.

Trailer, big green stripe.

Yep.

Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you.

May I have a moment of your time?

I have a friend I met doing some missionary work years ago.

He preaches at a small church across the bridge there.

And he's been trying for years to get me to come out and visit him, so I decided to take my friend up on his offer and come here to Jarden.

The plan was to stay for about a week.

We've been here for three months now.

How?

Religious exemption.

They gave Mary and I wristbands that said sanctuary on them.

This morning a man attacked us and took those wristbands and now they will not let us back in.

Sandy, I'm asking for your help.

I'm calling upon your sense of community and charity.

Mary and I need some money so that I can--

How much?

$500.

I know that's an extraordinary amount of money, but I give you my word as a Christian I will pay you back.

What denomination?

20s. It's whatever you can--

No, no, you're a reverend. What denomination?

Episcopalian.

Why?

My father was a reverend, I was raised in the faith, but I welcome all beliefs into my church.

Where'd you go to seminary?

It's the only time in over three years she's talked to me.

And there may be no way to prove it, but it happened and I won't ever say it didn't.

I don't want your wristband.

Mary found hers, so she's back where she belongs and I have no doubt that she'll wake up again soon.

And when she does, I'm going to come back and you and I will have a talk.

Nothing. It's okay.

Kevin?

Kev... Kevin?

Ah, f*ck.

Michael: She's still not answering.

John: Wait. Get in the truck.

(phone ringing)

Hi, this is Kevin Garvey. Leave a message.

(beeps)

Kevin, where are you? Your truck is here.

You need to call me.

(engine starts)

Don't know where you are. You need to call me.

(tires squeal)

Are you okay?

Evie didn't come home last night.

She was out with her friends and they're gone, too.

Gone?

Oh, f*ck. Oh, f*ck!

Okay.

Operator: 911, what's your emergency?

Did... did it happen again?

Ma'am, can you repeat...

I can't find my... My boyfriend isn't here.

Did it... did it happen?

Ma'am, if you've experienced the earthquake...

No, no, not the f*cking earthquake.

Not the f*cking earthquake. Did it ha... did...

Are the people gone?

(door opens)

Are they gone?

Looks like you have some explaining to do, sport.

(glasses clinking)

Hey, have you seen my phone?

I had cigarettes in here.

Maybe you smoked them while you were out sleepwalking.

Where'd you go?

I woke up in a drained pond.

When I crawled out, there was a car parked up on top.

A white Mercedes. It was empty.

Then I saw another car coming.

It was John, the neighbor.

His son was with him.

I think my phone is probably up there.

They're gonna find it.

I think I should tell the cops.

Tell them what?

You're gonna say you don't remember anything before you woke up in the exact spot where our neighbor's daughter and her two friends disappeared from?

Wait, Evie's missing?

(knocking on door)

(knocking continues)

This your truck parked out front?

Yeah.

Putting together a search and rescue out the woods.

Gonna need to rig some winches.

Think you can help us out?

Yeah, sure.

Just follow me over here.

Yes, I'll unhook my trailer over here.

All right.

Need help?

No.

Okay.

(crowd clamoring)

Ranger over P.A.: This area is restricted.

We need you to stay behind the line.

Come in. Go, go.

Ranger over P.A.: Stay behind the tape, please.

Whoa, hold on.

Ranger 2 over P.A.: Do not park your vehicle here.

There's a table up the road for volunteers.

(clamor continues)

Jesus.

You woke up down there?

Yeah.

I came up that embankment.

That's when I saw the car.

You should get down there.

If someone else finds your phone, you can say you just lost it today.

That's pretty f*cking smart.

Thanks.

You might want to start at the car and work your way back down.

Where are you going?

To find the girls.

(camera clicking)

(camera clicking)

Ranger: Hey. Can I help you?

Oh, I'm part of the rescue. I brought the winch in.

Wristband.

Sorry?

I need to scan your wristband.

Oh, yeah. Of course.

Ranger: We had to close the park down.

(beeps)

Make sure everyone belongs here.

It says temporary, but we just bought a house, so...

They told us to keep wearing it.

You bought a house? Where?

Um...

Uh, Stanton.

You have an address?

It's 41, I think.

You think?

Yeah.

Vega, that's my neighbor.

Oh, yeah, sure, John.

Want to give us a hand?

Yeah.

Take that.

(megaphone squeals)

Ranger over P.A.: Thanks for coming out.

We appreciate you helping us with this.

You see anything that don't belong, don't touch it.

Leave a ribbon, find one of us.

Let's go.

(dog barking)

Woman: God be in my head and in my understanding.

God be in mine eyes and in my looking.

God be at mine end and at my departing.

We are the 9,261. We are spared.

All: We are the 9,261.

We are spared.

Woman: For that, we are grateful.

Amen.

All: Amen.

All: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

♪ Gonna make some formula for you... ♪

Oh... shit.

Okay. Whoa.

Hi.

Hi.

I heard about your sister.

My dad and Nora went to go help, you know, look for her.

Thanks.

Why are you wet?

Do you know how to fix a sink?

(chuckles)

(faint music playing)

That's it.

I got it?

Yeah.

You got it.

(exhales)

Sorry I bothered you. Didn't know what else to do.

It's okay.

What?

Why aren't you with them looking for her?

I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.

You don't have to answer that.

My sister isn't here anymore.

Where is she?

When I talk about this to people like you, they just look at me like I'm crazy.

People like me?

Who don't believe in God.

(Lily fussing)

I think I just made your sister uncomfortable.

You don't make me feel uncomfortable.

I should get back.

Thanks for saving me.

Any time.

(door closes)

(clamoring)

Get back!

I'm not telling you again.

Ranger: Make room for these people, now.

Come on!

Let's go, let 'em through. Let 'em through.

Close it up.

Hey, step back!

Nothing down there.

Man: You sure?

Certain.

Thank God.

This is our neighbor Kevin. Sam and Loretta.

How are you?

Kevin: Sam.

John: Emily.

Their daughters were with Evie.

Oh, I'm sorry.

If there's anything we can do to help...

Hey, they're towing the car up to Austin.

Didn't find anything?

Nothing came up on the black light.

They did pull a palm print off the driver's side window.

What?

Yeah, the state guy said it was too big to be one of the girls'.

A palm print?

(clamoring escalates)

Ranger: Stop that! No, stop!

God, these f*cking animals.

Okay, we'll get 'em out of here.

No, let them.

It's just water.

(choir singing)

(insects chirping)

(chatter)

Any luck?

No.

If the phone turns up, I'll just say I dropped it today, you know, like you said.

So I should just keep looking?

That's probably a good idea.

(truck door opens)

Here.

Are we okay?

Yeah, we're okay.

Love you.

I love you, too, Kevin.

(engine starts)

Thanks.

(bleats)

(faint music playing)

(bell jingles)

Earthquake?

Woman: Yeah.

(bell jingles)

What can I do you for?

Can I get a fifth of Wild Turkey and a carton of Reds, please?

Shit, forgot my wallet.

Put it on my tab.

You don't have to do that.

Eh, my pleasure.

Looks like you got a fun night planned.

But you really shouldn't smoke.

They're for my boyfriend. I'm enabling him.

Ah.

Give me your address. I'll pay you back.

No, no, consider it a gift from me to your boyfriend.

Thank you, sir. I'm Nora.

(cash register beeping)

Virgil. Virgil.

I'm so sorry for your loss.

What?

Your loss.

What a horrible thing.

Woman: God damn it, Virgil, what did I tell you?

You want to come in here, you can't do this shit.

Get out.

I'm sorry if I caused any distress.

(door opens, bell jingles)

(honks horn)

I know exactly where your phone is.

I can tell you what happened to those girls, too.

All you have to do is ask.

Smart. Retrace your steps.

You're a regular f*cking Hardy Boy.

Dipshits, those two.

Hey, why didn't you tell Nora about the whole cinder block tied around your ankle thing?

You afraid she'll jump to conclusions?

I know what conclusion I'd jump to.

You're cold, buddy. Cold, cold, cold.

Cold.

Warm.

Oh, yeah. Getting warmer.

Oh!

Oh, yeah. Warmer.

You're getting real hot now, Kevin.

I lost my phone when I was out here earlier today.

Find it?

Yeah, I did. It's bricked, so...

I was gonna maybe go check with the rangers, see if they needed some help in the woods.

They ain't gonna find nothing in the woods.

Hop in, I'll give you a ride.

No, uh, Nora was gonna come back, swing around, pick me up.

Hop in, man. I got you.

All right.

What's that?

Birthday present.

Feel that quake last night?

What?

Earthquake.

Did it wake you up?

Oh, yeah. Yeah, that woke us.

Hand me one of those.

You can help yourself.

I'm good.

(can tab pops)

Thought you didn't drink.

My daughter's missing.

Don't... we live back there.

Patrick.

John, hey.

How you holding up?

Open the gate, please.

The natives in the camp are restless 'cause we closed the park.

You might want to roll your window up.

Will do.

We're here for you, man.

(crowd clamoring)

These f*cking people wait for weeks to get in for 10 hours just so they can buy a T-shirt.

I think they're looking for more than a T-shirt.

Yeah?

Well, what are you looking for?

A fresh start.

No, you paid $3 million for a house that's cracking apart just so you could live on the other side of that bridge.

What you were looking for is to feel safe.

Man: Hey, what's going on in there?

Why won't they let anybody in?

What happened to you guys?!

No safer here than anywhere else.

Of that I am sure.

There are no miracles in Miracle.

(siren wailing)

God damn it.

(tires squealing)

What's happening?

Stay in the car.

T.J.: You need to go home now.

No, I told you guys what I need. Now move your damn truck.

What's he doing here?

John: I asked you to go with me, you said no, so he's coming.

Now move your truck.

John, listen to me.

Isaac didn't do anything.

There was a palm print on the car that my daughter was in.

Like it was left for me. A g*dd*mn palm print.

(conversation continues)

Patti: Lucky duck.

John: We have a problem. Now I'm going to take care of it.

Looks like you framed someone without even trying.

T.J.: Isaac didn't do anything.

John: I don't have time.

I'm not hearing that.

Jesus, John.

John!

Hold on.

(engine starts)

John!

John, don't do this.

Come on, brother, what are you doing, huh?

What are you doing?

Hey, hey, what are you doing?

I'm gonna go talk to somebody.

Who?

A liar.

Said he could tell people their future.

Said something bad was gonna happen to me, now my daughter's gone.

Why would he have your daughter?

Well, I might have b*rned down his house.

You coming with me?

Hey, hey! Why'd you bring me here, man?

What?

You picked me up.

Why? 'Cause you wanted company?

'Cause your friends said you weren't thinking straight?

No.

Well, you're not.

Let me talk to this guy.

No, come on, man. Step aside.

Hang on, hang on.

You think he's gonna let you in the door with that bat?

I was a cop.

No shit.

No shit.

Look, if he knows anything about your daughter or knows anything about these girls, then I'll f*cking know.

We'll take it from there.

What's his name?

Isaac.

All right, Isaac.

What room is he in?

12.

All right, so I'll go talk to Isaac.

You wait here.

All right.

All right.

Wait here.

Gosh, you sure defused that b*mb.

Nice work, Chief.

My husband Neil... sorry, my ex-husband...

Was engaging in some pretty suspicious texting activity and then he would leave late at night to go to the office.

""To the office."" That was the best he could do.

I mean, put some f*cking originality into it, Neil.

So I followed him to a motel just like this one.

Sat in the car.

I watched while he walked into the room.

And I considered turning around and going back home.

I was scared, Kevin.

Scared that when I caught him, it'd be over.

He would leave me.

But I needed to see, to know.

So got out of my car, walked over to the room and I took a peek.

There was Neil buck naked and some woman.

She had her shirt on. That was it.

She was taking a shit on him, Kevin.

A shit.

I was married to that assh*le for 17 years and never once did he ask me to shit on him.

(knocking)

Laurie ever tell you about that?

She was my shrink for a long time.

Security.

I always wondered whether that doctor-patient confidentiality thing was bullshit.

(knocking) Security.

Can you please open your door?

Is Isaac here?

Who?

(thumping)

John: Open this door!

I know you're in there! You used your credit card!

John!

(glass shatters)

Open this...

(g*n)

Oh, shit.

(John shouting)

(glass shatters)

Let go of me!

He knows where she is! Where is she?

Enough of this shit, John!

Hey, relax. It's okay.

Relax? Get the f*ck out of my room!

You've been sh*t. You've been sh*t.

Where is she?

Who?

My daughter.

Whatever you're looking for, it ain't here.

Now get the f*ck out of my room, John Murphy.

Go.

Let's do that.

Let's go back.

Isaac: Go.

(whispering) Let's go.

Let's go. Let's go.

Isaac: Ain't nothing more dangerous than a man who don't believe in nothing.

Hey.

We gotta get you to a hospital, man.

No.

You're sh*t.

You need to go see a doctor.

No hospitals.

You said before you'd do anything to help.

Well, help.

Hey, I'm driving.

(groans)

(engine starts)

(tires squeal)

Hey, babe.

I got sh*t.

(door opens)

Hey.

Hey.

She asleep?

Yeah.

I couldn't find the box with the books in it, so I made up a story.

Did it have a happy ending?

What kind of a sick f*ck do you think I am?

Where's Dad?

He's still out there looking.

You're 18, right?

17.

Close enough.

(dog barking)

Why do you think he sleepwalks?

I don't know.

Stress?

The town was losing its shit and he was in charge.

And I guess now he needs to lose his shit, too.

He's not in charge anymore.

And we left town.

Wherever you go, there you are.

Young lady, you are wise.

(pours whiskey)

Michael, the boy next door... he says his sister departed.

She didn't depart.

How do you know that?

Because I do.

How?

Before I worked in benefits in the DSD, they had me in the fraudulent claims department.

People who said their family members departed so they could get a check.

My b*at was secondary departures.

I got assigned this woman.

She and her husband used to walk their dog together every morning.

It was about a year and a half after the 14th.

And as they're walking out the front door, the phone rings.

So she goes back inside and she picks it up.

Talks for like 30 seconds and hangs up.

When she steps back outside, there's the dog, leash just lying on the ground, husband's gone.

So the logical explanation is that he went where 140 million other people went...

Into thin air.

I found that f*ck in Puerto Rico.

He was careful.

He made small withdrawals from their bank account for six months so he could build a nest egg, and then he just chose his moment and he ran.

Why?

Because he had the greatest scapegoat in the history of civilization.

The Sudden Departure was a one-time-only event.

The flood happened three years ago on October 14th, and the ark took on all the animals it needed.

Why in God's name would it take on any more?

Kevin: All right.

(groans)

Easy, easy.

Lay back. Lay back.

Easy. Just lie back, lie back.

(groans)

You're all right.

What was it?

.22 through the door.

Erika: It's not that deep. I can see the b*llet.

I think I should just go.

You're good here.

What's that?

It's for the pain.

No, no, I don't want to be knocked out.

Okay.

(groans)

Just relax.

That's better.

She knocked me out.

I thought I could find her.

I know. I know.

(sighs)

(door opens)

I gotta go out. Will you keep an eye on Lily?

Yeah. Where are you going?

Church.

Matt: If they asked me, I'd say lean into it.

That's the sermon they need to hear.

These people haven't been in this situation.

I offer expertise based on experience.

But they're not gonna ask.

I'll sit there while Winston goes on about Proverbs and the congregation's eyes glaze over.

Nora.

Is it real?

What?

Is this place real?

I'm not sure I understand the question.

One of the only reasons we chose this place was because you said it was special.

You told us we would feel safe here.

Now I'm waking up to f*cking earthquakes and missing teenagers.

My boxes aren't even unpacked and it's the same g*dd*mn thing I left.

Mary woke up.

What?

The very first night we were here.

I thought I was dreaming, but she was back.

I said we should go to the hospital, but Mary, she just wanted to talk.

The last thing she remembered was the accident, so I told her everything that happened since.

We talked for hours.

And we cried.

Until we fell asleep in each other's arms.

(choir singing)

And when I woke up, she was like this again.

For some reason, the people in this town don't want me to talk about what happened.

Maybe they don't believe me.

Maybe you don't.

But I got a glimpse, a moment.

And every day since I've wondered if it's ever gonna happen again.

If I'll get her back for good this time.

But the one thing I've never wondered is if it's real.

It's real.

(crickets chirping)

(dog barking)

You left this at our house.

Thanks.

What are those for?

There's one on our house, too.

_

Before park services took over, some people from the government came by to every house to make sure it was true.

That no one was gone.

Oh.

Do you want to come in?

I can't. I'm watching Lily.

You alone?

Mm-hmm.

Me, too.

(crying)

John said he b*rned that guy's house down.

The guy who sh*t him.

Well, then I guess they're even now.

(metal clanging)

Burning down houses is new.

Usually he just gives a warning.

Warning for what?

(sighs)

When people found out about what happened here, there was a lot of confusion.

And then there were claims, claims that were untrue.

John was in at the time.

But when he came home and saw what was going on... he wasn't having it.

""There are no miracles in Miracle.""

He gave you the speech?

Mm-hmm.

Evie was a miracle.

She came too early.

24 weeks.

You know, a lot of people don't know that twins can be born two months apart.

Michael, he stayed put, but Evie, she couldn't wait to get started.

She was one pound, one ounce.

(chuckles)

Now look at her.

I know what people are saying.

They're saying that something bad happened.

She's... playing a joke and she's giggling in the woods.

No one would ever want to hurt Evie.

She would never want to hurt anybody else.

She's better than that.

She is exceptional.

Exceptional.

Just like this town.

Things are gonna change now.

I like them, the Murphys.

They're exciting.

And that Erika is something, huh?

Gets the call her husband's been f*cking sh*t.

She just pulls the b*llet out, no questions asked.

That's real commitment. That's trust. That's love. Not like what you've got.

What you've got, Kevin, isn't love.

It's damage control.

Your family blew up, Nora's family blew up.

And now you're all just clinging on to each other 'cause you need to cling on to something.

That's why she bought the house. She didn't really care whether you wanted to or not.

Her money, her choice.

That must have been emasculating.

And you... Jesus.

If you loved them, you'd trust them enough to tell them about me.

If you loved them, you wouldn't lie.

Shut the f*ck up!

I didn't tell them about you because you're not f*cking here.

I love my family.

I love them.

Then why did you try to k*ll yourself?

What?

Come on.

This isn't a big mystery.

I was right there with you.

You walked out of your house in the middle of the night and you found a rope and a cinder block and then you tied it to your ankle and you threw it into a g*dd*mn lake.

Let's face it, Kevin, there are people who try to commit su1c1de for attention.

And then there are people who really want to f*cking die.

Like me and you.

I watched you do it.

And you did not hesitate, my friend.

Plunk.

Right into the wet abyss.

And if not for an act of divine intervention, you'd be gone.

I'm sorry, Kevin, but these are not the actions of a man who loves his family.

I don't want to k*ll myself.

Well... (sighs) you're certainly entitled to your opinion.

I'm just glad we finally talked about it.

Oh... since you didn't seem to give a shit enough to ask me, I'll tell you.

They vanished.

The girls.

Drove right by in their car listening to their music, not a worry in the world.

Then poof, gone.

Mama was right.

Things are gonna change indeed.

Laurie: So there's a bathroom down the hall.

It's not locked, but as long as you're in there after 9:00, you probably won't see anyone.

I need to go across the street to get some of my things, but if it's okay, I'd like to come back and sleep here for the next few nights so you're not alone.

Is that okay?

These are for you.

Oh, and... my number is the only one programmed in there, so if you need anything ever, you just call me.

The phone can't text, so you'll have to talk.

You married?

Kids?

Me, too.

Tommy, the one that brought you out, he's my son.

If you let me, I will help you come back.

[pen scratching]

You can.

I did.

Wayne on computer: But I am grateful for it.

And I don't need to know how it works.

I just need to know that the world... [button pops] [volume increases] is in decay.

And I can feel your pain coming off you in hot, throbbing waves.

And I can take it.

I can take it from you.

Who wants a hug?

What time is it?

It's almost midnight.

Go sleep in my bed.

I'm gonna go back over there, be with her.

You want me to make you a sandwich?

No.

You find the next hive yet?

Don't call them that.

Why?

Because they're people, Tommy, not insects.

[coughs] I know they're people.

I did hear of a house in Hackensack.

It's got almost 30 members.

You know, you just got to give yourself a few days, get yourself back.

Myself back?

I'm worried about you.

They know your face now.

Maybe you should try something else.

They don't know shit.

Chapters are spread all over.

They don't talk to each other.

Jesus, they don't talk at all.

[laughs]

It only works from the inside.

It's the only way for me to get them to trust me.

The only way for me to get them to trust you.

f*ck Hackensack.

You go get 'em, kiddo.

You ever miss it?

What?

The quiet.

No.

[door opens, closes]

[keyboard clicking]

Susan: What is that?

Sorry?

What are you writing?

Oh, it's a book.

[keyboard clicking]

[clicking stops]

What's it about?

It's about us.

There she is. Dr. Ruth.

Hey, good morning, Viktor.

You got a light?

I quit.

Really? Me, too. Here, let me get this for you.

So how's the counseling business?

So far so good.

Really?

If you need anything else in the space, I got a guy who can rent you out some furniture.

No, we're okay. We're okay.

And, hey, I know... I know it's a little late, but I'll have the check for you on Friday, okay?

Yeah, all right. No problems.

That's great. Yeah, uh, Laurie?

It's gonna be an extra 200 here on out, okay?

Why?

Because this is a commercial building and you got people living there.

No, no, sometimes I work late.

Yeah, well, you know, these toilets, they can handle day poops, not night poops.

Okay, look... I'm writing a book.

It's going really well, but, you know, money's just a little tight right now.

Yeah, well, see if you can shake some loose.

Okay.

Are those bagels?

Oh.

[soft music playing]

Woman: Everybody walks around like nothing happened.

They don't even think about it.

Like they just had it erased or something.

The stuff they care about just feels so stupid sometimes.

What do you care about?

[soft music continues]

My family.

Was that a question? 'Cause your voice kind of went up at the end.

Oh. [laughs]

We were eating dinner, it was nice.

And then my husband said something, I said something back.

And while I'm talking I'm thinking, ""This is so fake. You're in someone else's movie and you're just saying lines.""

I felt... outside.

b*at the f*ck out of inside.

[group laughs]

You are not welcome here.

How'd they find us?

Doesn't matter.

They can't hurt you now.

They're cowards.

[paper crumples]

You leave.

[music playing]

And then after a while, he asked me if I wanted to come in.

What did you talk about?

How Kyle was doing.

Glenn got him a tutor over the summer.

And then he asked me if I was coming home.

Sounds like you're surprised.

I didn't think he'd want me to.

But he does.

Maybe.

You don't believe him?

He was just so nice.

I mean, I was just gone for almost two months and it was just like water under the bridge.

Because I know he's angry.

You don't know that. Maybe he just wants you home.

Yeah, but he's angry, too.

Like you.

I'm not angry.

Okay.

Susan... your family doesn't want to hit you.

They want to forgive you.

[door opens]

This is Howard.

I told him it was safe here.

Hello, Howard.

I'm Laurie.

Would you like to join us?

Newscaster on TV: Resurrection?

That's the claim from Australia as witnesses describe a man previously believed dead emerging from a cave in Wanneroo outside the city of Perth.

Man: Walked out covered in mozzie bites, saying he'd just been in a hotel.

Newscaster: The man, identified as David Burton...

I made you a grilled cheese.

Jill texted you.

You went through my phone?

It was lying right there and it buzzed, and I couldn't help it.

You two are meeting tomorrow?

Can I drive you?

She's not ready yet, Mom.

If I wrote her a note, would you give it to her?

Okay.

Can I drive you?

I promise, she won't even see me.

It'll be like I'm not even there.

Okay.

What are you doing?

Nothing. There was a... It's nothing.

[sighs] Jill's happy.

Did she take my letter?

Yeah.

Yeah, she did.

[engine starts]

[chattering]

What's going on?

The door's padlocked.

They threw us out. They put all the stuff in the hallway.

No.

Susan: Where am I gonna stay?

Tom: It's okay. We can meet at our apartment. We'll figure this out, okay?

Has anybody seen my laptop?

Are you sure it was in there, Mom?

Yes, Tom. I was writing here this morning.

And this is everything? This was everything in the hallway?

Mom, Mom, calm down.

My book was on it and I don't have a backup.

You didn't email it to yourself?

That f*ck took it.

I know I'm behind, but I can get you that money.

I just need to move some things around.

Okay, so as soon as you do, you can get your space back.

I need my laptop.

Your what?

My laptop. It was in the office.

It was on one of those cots.

The cots no one's sleeping on?

[chuckles]

Mm-hmm.

Viktor, look, I'm sorry.

My work, the people that I'm helping, they need... I...

I shouldn't have lied to you.

And I will get you that money.

You can even have the laptop.

I just need one file off of it: my book.

I just... I can't write it again.

I just cannot start over.

If I give you your file back, that would be proof that I have your computer.

Is that your son?

Mm-hmm.

Don't you want to go home tonight and tell him that you're a good man?

That somebody asked for help and you gave it to them?

My kid's an assh*le.

And I don't have your laptop.

[distant train horn blaring]

[car doors close, engine starts]

[dog barking]

[phone rings]

[speaking Russian]

[drums playing]

[woman continues in Russian]

[grunts]

Boy: Mom!

Mom! Mom!

What the f*ck?

Hey! Hey! [tapping]

Who the f*ck are you?

What did you do in my house? Hey!

[tires squealing]

What the f*ck?

[drumming stops]

[breathing heavily]

[music blaring]

[turns off music]

[revving engine]

[tires squealing]

[music resumes]

[cash register beeping]

Laurie: Is your mattress soft?

Sorry?

Susan is used to sleeping on the floor and then a cot, so comfort takes some getting used to.

Oh. Oh.

It's one of those foam memory ones, you know, that adapts to your contours.

Wow. That's fancy.

Well, you might find Susan sleeping on the floor or on the couch, and if that happens, I would just gently encourage her to come back to bed.

Yeah, I...

I can do that.

What are you thinking?

She gonna talk about it?

Look, I don't want to say something that makes her leave again.

My husband, or my ex-husband Kevin, he thought that I left because of him, too.

Of course he did. I couldn't tell him otherwise.

[laughs]

You didn't make her leave.

They did.

She's not gonna leave you again.

And she's not gonna go back to them.

Tell him.

I'm not.

Thank you.

Welcome home.

You want to follow me around, huh?!

You want to stand outside my f*cking house?!

You want to say something to me, you little p*ssy?

Talk!

f*cking talk!

[coughs]

[people coughing]

[blowing whistle]

Shh, shh.

You don't have to do that. You don't have to...

Get the f*ck off me!

Hey, I didn't do... Get the f*ck...

Get off me!

f*ck! f*ck you!

f*ck you! Get...

[engine humming]

[brakes squeak]

[truck hisses]

[doors open]

[footsteps]

[metal clanking]

Listen, you don't have to...

I didn't do anything.

[doors clang shut]

Wait, what are you... what are you doing?

You don't...

Hey.

Wait. Wait.

[breathing heavily]

[moaning]

Get the f*ck off me! Get off me!

[handcuffs click]

f*ck you! Get off me!

Get off me!

Hey...

[screams] f*ck!

[screaming]

f*ck!

[breathing heavily]

Please.

Please don't.

Tell your mom Meg says hello.

[engine starts]

[truck engine starts]

[tires squeal]

[music playing in background]

Woman: It's a great piece.

A special occasion?

Oh, it's for a meeting.

With a publisher.

I wrote a book.

I mean, I just sent it to some places.

I wasn't holding my breath, you know?

But then one called and wanted me to come in.

So that's got to be good, right?

It's got to be.

Right, it's 849.

What's your return policy?

Who's Meg?

What?

Who's Meg?

What? Why aren't you at the New Rochelle house?

Who is she, Mom?!

S-she's a woman in... in Mapleton.

I... When I was on the inside, they had me recruit her.

I haven't really seen her since I got out.

You recruited her?

Yeah.

Like you recruited me?

Tommy, that's not...

It's f*cking useless, you know?

What?

The program! The meetings!

What we're doing!

It's not working, Mom.

Honey, tell me what happened.

What happened is I'm in there. I'm in there with them.

But you forgot what it's like. They make sense.

They know something.

No, that's it. You're done.

You're done. You are not going back in there.

And you don't need to.

They are going to publish my book, Tommy.

And when people read about what's going on in those houses, we will win.

We are going to b*at them.

This is working.

Sweetie... this is working.

[rain pattering]

[rain noise turns off]

[alarm chiming]

[alarm turns off]

Good morning.

Morning.

[TV playing]

[music playing]

[chatter]

Glenn: Come on, what did he think I meant?

The guy's got ignorance down to an art form.

Shit, I mean science.

Down to a science.

I mean, you can't be responsible for anything if you say you don't understand it.

You know?

But you try and pin him down about it, then he just looks at you.

And he's like, ""Well, why do you care so much anyway?""

Then you're on the defensive just like that.

I don't know.

Just praying for the day that he gets transferred.

Whole place would be better off.

Honey, you're in the wrong lane.

[horns honking]

Whoa, hey! No, you can't.

[horns honking]

Susan, it's the wrong lane! Susan, stop!

It's the wrong lane. Stop! Jesus Christ!

[horn blaring]

Stop!

[silent]

[honking continues]

Receptionist: Hi, may I help you?

Yes, I have an 11:00 appointment with Peter Benedetto.

It's Laurie Garvey.

Great.

[beeps]

Laurie's here.

Okay.

They'll be ready for you in just a few minutes.

You can have a seat right there.

Can I get you something to drink?

Uh, no. I'm great.

They love your book.

They do?

Oh, yeah.

Big time.

[chuckles]

[phone rings, buzzes]

Hi, it's Laurie.

I'm sorry, what?

Uh, no. I...

I just... Can you...

I need you to slow down and say that again.

Do you know if they're...

Okay.

Okay, I'll try...

Okay. No, I...

I'll call you back.

I'm... I'm so sorry. I'm gonna have to...

I just found out a friend of mine was in an accident.

Laurie. Peter.

I'm not kidding, I've been waiting for this all week.

Ready to come on back?

Sure.

Come on. Come on.

Well, Laurie, I should tell you we almost never accept unsolicited material, but Kerry here is the queen of the slush pile and she came to me and she said,

""I think I may have just read the next 'What's Next.'""

You know ""What's Next,"" right?

Patrick Johansen.

Oh, yes. Of course.

Yeah, it was a huge book. Inspirational.

People wanted to know how he was able to move on.

And you, you're coming at this from a completely different angle.

[phone ringing] - The whole cult thing from an insider's perspective.

I love it.

I'm so sorry.

Let me just put this on silent.

Hey, there's a great alt title.

""Let Me Just Put This On Silent.""

[laughs]

So listen, Laurie, as soon as we have a deal locked in, I want you and Martin to sit down together.

He did ""What's Next,"" ""Departure 3.0.""

He's a great editor.

And he's got some terrific ideas.

Help you sharpen the edges. Get some clarity to it.

Clarity?

Um, yeah. Like the smoking.

You never really explain why they make you smoke all the time.

Because it was never really explained to me.

Martin: Yeah, but they have a story, right?

I don't understand.

A story. A myth.

A rule book that says do this this way or else.

Like for instance, the Catholics believe that Christ died on the cross for our sins.

The Branch Davidians believe that God told David Koresh to f*ck his own daughters.

This wing nut in Australia says that he went to the other side and he can't die.

We know what the Guilty Remnant does, but what do they believe?

They believe the world ended.

Okay, all right. All right, great.

So that's... You and Martin will work on that.

But the bigger issue is we've got to put some feeling into this thing.

Sorry?

Feeling.

Emotion.

I mean, there's some heartbreaking stuff in here.

Um...

The lighter.

[snaps fingers] The lighter.

From your daughter with the engraving ""Please come home, Mom.""

It said ""Don't forget me.""

Even better.

See, Laurie, that's what this book wants to be.

If you want people to connect with it, you have to tell them how it felt.

How what felt?

The realization.

When you figured out that these people that you left your family for are f*cking whack jobs.

[stammers] Okay.

Oh, your daughter, um...

Jill.

Jill, yes.

The fire.

My God, when I read that, I couldn't believe it.

But the fact-checkers said you were there.

And Jill, she was there because these people had you brainwashed, right?

Then they got you to let your own daughter into the house so that you would burn together.

But then you break free.

And when you finally speak for the first time in, what was it, a year, you shout Jill's name to your husband, the same guy these people made you divorce.

And he goes running in.

I mean, she's in there because of you.

But you can't save her.

He's the one to save her because all you can do is stand there and watch.

And I know all of this, Laurie, because you put it in your book.

But what I don't know, Laurie, and what I need to know... is how you feel about it.

[screaming]

[door buzzes]

Officer: Garvey.

They like my book.

[crying]

What she did, it wasn't our fault.

She was f*cked up, Mom. We tried.

They won't jump out of the way.

What?

I don't want to hurt them, but they won't jump out of the way.

Mom, I know you're f*cked up, but everyone's back at our place right now and they're all losing their shit.

So can you keep yours together?

Why are we losing?

Because they're giving them something.

We can strip it away, but once it's gone, we have nothing to put back in its place.

Well, let's give them something.

Laurie: Therapists have a lot of rules.

Only one really matters:

don't talk about yourself.

I spent the first weeks after the Departure just waiting.

I'm still waiting.

We all are.

I had a patient who said she could feel that something terrible was gonna happen.

And it did.

So the next time I saw her a few months later, she was wearing white, smoking a cigarette.

She knew I was afraid and confused and alone.

And the next thing I knew, I was screaming my daughter's name thinking that I had k*ll her.

Her name is Jill.

And I don't think she'll ever speak to me again.

But there is another story.

[sniffles]

It's one that I've kept to myself because I had to to protect my son.

Tell them.

Tell them, Tommy.

They need you to.

Have you heard of Holy Wayne?

Yeah.

He said he could take people's pain away.

I didn't believe him at first, but then I saw him do it.

He would just hug them and they'd be okay.

I don't know why, I don't know why him, but I know it worked.

So I followed him wherever he went and I did whatever he asked of me.

And then they came to k*ll him.

We got away, but we had to split up.

He asked me to protect this girl, a pregnant girl.

She gave birth... and then she just left the baby.

Just abandoned it in a f*cking rest stop bathroom.

The baby, she was crying and I didn't know what to do.

I was alone.

So I looked up at the ceiling and said, ""Help.""

Not to God.

Not to anyone. I just said it.

10 seconds later, there's a knock on the door.

It was Wayne.

I don't know how he found me.

Nobody knew where I was.

The baby stopped crying and... he told me where to take her.

She'd be safe.

And then he said he was gonna die.

Yeah.

I asked him when and he said tomorrow.

I asked him why he wasn't afraid.

And he said, ""I haven't been afraid in a real long time.""

Then he told me one more thing.

He said if I accepted it, that I could do what he did.

I could take people's pain away.

But there'd be a price.

There's always a price, though.

But I wanted it anyway.

I wanted to do what he could do.

I wanted to be... something.

So I said yes.

And he wrapped his arms around me and I felt everything I was, everything I ever would be.

And I felt it get born and die over and over again.

And then he let go.

[crying]

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.

I've been afraid to use it.

Been afraid of what it was.

Of what it would become.

But I can't let you hurt anymore.

I can't be afraid anymore.

So... who wants a hug?

We don't really know each other.

Okay.

I've been walking in my sleep.

I was taking medication.

So I tossed my pills.

I figured that'd be the end of it, but then I...

I grabbed Patti Levin... and I took her to a cabin.

And when I woke up...

I tried to let her go, but she wouldn't let me.

And she k*ll herself.

So I called your brother Matt and we... we buried her.

She's mine.

Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

What's going on?

[crying continues]

[phone ringing]

Hello.

Hell... one second.

Hey, I'm on my way home.

The old washer is busted, so I had to be at the laund...

What? No.

You said 11:00.

Oh, shit. Look, I'm sorry.

I love... f*ck.

[beeping]

[crying continues]

[song continues]

I swear to God I thought you said 11:00.

It's okay.

Here, give her.

I've got to fix that f*cking washing machine.

Kevin, it's okay. Here.

Three loads at the laundromat.

You're gonna do all the talking, right?

You'll be great. Just tell them it felt like it was meant to be.

Felt like it was meant to be. Felt like it was meant to be.

You can put it in your own words.

I got it.

Deep breath. Clear it out, man.

[exhales]

Good.

Let's go make a family.

[mouths words]

She was on your porch?

No, it was Kevin's porch. I was just the one...

Was there a note?

Uh-uh. It was just her in her car seat.

So no idea of who left her there?

No.

Kevin was the chief of police, so we assumed...

You're a cop?

I was. I took a leave so I could help with the baby.

It felt like it was meant to be.

Any other kids?

My daughter lives with us.

She's great with the baby.

My children were both departures.

Sorry to hear that.

Thank you.

Any other relatives in the area?

Um, my dad lives nearby.

He's not really in the, you know.

Not really what?

He's in a psychiatric facility.

But he's not dangerous or anything.

He's...

No.

Marital status?

Well, we live together.

We were both previously married.

We're committed, obviously.

We love each other.

Very, very much.

Yeah.

In the event of a separation, who would take care of the child?

We're not going to separate.

But if you did.

We're not.

We're not.

[sighs]

Would you like to adopt another child?

We want this one.

In addition to this one.

[laughs] Um...

One month old, adorable.

He's white, though.

I'm sorry, no. We're... we're good.

Yeah, we're pretty...

Yeah.

Name of the child?

Lily with one L.

Lily with one L.

Now, I want you to take this to any of the judges down the hall.

The wait shouldn't be too bad.

So...

Congratulations.

She's all yours.

She's all ours.

[laughing]

We got you.

[engine, radio shut off]

There's a body in the back of my truck.

You're my sister. Did you know that?

We're sisters. See?

What's she wearing?

It was in the box that your brother sent.

Check it out.

Aw, that was sweet of him.

Hi. You want to go for a walk with us?

Um, no. I'm gonna meet a friend for coffee.

Is he cute?

Not as cute as he used to be.

Remember, we have dinner at 7:00.

Dad's gonna wear a sport coat and everything, so get ready to celebrate.

Oh, I'm ready.

Thank you.

Anything else I can get you?

Sorry, it's not for me. [Laughs]

Waiting for someone who's just 20 minutes late.

Okay.

Looking good, Billy Ray.

Feeling good, Louis.

Sorry, I'm sick.

Oh.

I don't want to infect you.

That sucks.

I ordered you a cheeseburger.

Thank you.

[sighs]

[sniffling]

Um, school good?

It's August.

[both laugh]

It's August.

You're right.

Yeah.

Um, Dad and Nora adopted the baby.

Wow.

They still calling it Lily?

Yeah, you don't like that?

Who cares what I like?

I care.

I mean, you gave her to us.

Did you tell Dad?

No.

Jill, did you?

No.

You can't tell Dad.

I promised you that I wouldn't.

You know, you should really just call him sometime.

He worries about you.

We're not starting that again, Jill.

Why are you so angry?

I'm not. I'm not angry.

Well, can I just tell him that I know you're okay?

No, Jill, you can't.

Why not?

'Cause nobody's okay.

I am.

And so is Dad and Nora.

[sniffles]

We're all okay.

That's good for you.

You deserve that.

One big, happy family.

Well, you can be a part of it.

I mean, anytime.

I'm sorry.

She, um... she wanted me to give this to you.

I love you.

I love you, too.

[phone ringing]

Hello.

Nora, Mike from Century.

Are you sitting down?

No, I'm standing.

There's an offer on your house. 2.7.

Million?

Yeah, million.

But we listed it for 600,000.

Why would they...

It's a preemptive bid.

Listen, they put it on a clock.

We have until end of day to respond.

So I'm saying yes, yes?

Nora?

Why are you offering me four times what I'm asking for my house?

Your residence has been flagged as a highly desirable property by a number of separate institutions.

What's your institution?

We're from MIT.

Good school.

It is, thank you.

We're spearheading a research project and the university is financing the grant.

To buy my house?

Yes.

Why?

Because it is anomalous.

It's a deviation from the statistical norm...

She knows what it means.

You want to buy my house because my husband and children disappeared from here.

Yes, and our deepest condolences for your loss.

So you have a guess?

Sorry?

If they're writing you a grant that big, you must have a guess as to where my family went.

We can't determine where, only why.

I don't understand.

Our guess is that it's a matter of geography.

Places.

And the richest data can be gathered from sites where multiple departures have occurred in the same proximity, like right here.

But I was here with them.

Our understanding is that your family was here at the table, but you were over by the sink, yes?

You're saying if I was sitting right here, I would have gone, too?

If you sell us your house, we'll be one step closer to answering that.

Then what?

Sorry?

If you're right, then what?

What does it matter?

People want to be able to protect themselves against a recurrence.

You think it's gonna happen again?

Why wouldn't it?

[door beeps, opens]

Staties offer you anything?

Some shitty coffee out there.

Lois Makepeace from ATFEC.

Kevin Garvey.

Want to ask about the eye?

No.

Most people are curious.

So they confirmed the ID of the body in your truck.

Patricia Levin.

Regional leadership of the Guilty Remnant.

She went by Patti.

Did you k*ll her?

No, I disinterred her body.

You know who did k*ll her?

She k*ll herself, but I was...

So she k*ll herself?

Yes, but I was responsible for...

But she k*ll herself?

Yes, she did.

I...

Don't care.

I don't care how you knew where she was buried or why you dug her up because I don't care about her.

I read your official resignation.

Chief Kevin Garvey of Mapleton PD.

You quit being a cop.

Probably 'cause this piece of shit Levin liked smoking and telling those other chickenshits in her little club to cause a riot in your g*dd*mn town.

So she k*ll herself.

The world spins on.

Good riddance, Patricia, we hardly f*cking knew ya.

Are you letting me go?

Do you want to blow your life up?

What?

Do you want to blow your life up?

No.

Then go home, Kevin Garvey.

[siren wailing]

What the f*ck was that?

[engine starts]

[Nora laughs]

Kevin Sr.: I'm losing circulation.

I know.

Kevin Sr.: She's got a grip on her.

Hey, there he is.

Hola, bambino.

Nora: Your dad's been released. Isn't that great?

Released? When?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

You're dubious.

I'm supposed to trust you just because you're wearing normal clothes, not a bathrobe?

Good fit, huh?

Guy I stole them off is in a ditch bleeding to death.

Boys.

Do you want to call the nuthouse?

What are they gonna tell me if I do?

[sighs]

That I'm cured.

And he's moving to Australia.

Not moving, just visiting for an indefinite period of time.

I'm gonna take her up for her nap and hop in the shower.

Okay.

Hi. Your son's taking us to dinner tonight.

He made a reservation and everything.

What a gentleman.

Nora: Why don't you two catch up?

[chuckles]

She's a great woman.

You said that about Laurie, too.

Well, I still like Laurie.

I just like Nora more.

Try not to drive her into a f*cking cult, okay?

[both laugh]

Jesus, your sense of humor is back.

Will wonders never cease?

I got to admit, it's pretty convincing.

What?

You.

You seem pretty normal.

You implying that I'm not?

Well... watched you for four years yelling at shit that wasn't even there.

Who says it wasn't there?

I don't know.

Laws of f*cking nature.

Well, son, wouldn't you agree that the laws of f*cking nature seemed a bit upside down as of late?

So, what, your voices, they just went away?

No, sir.

[sighs]

I just started doing what they told me to.

They tell you to go to Australia?

God, I love this town.

But now everywhere I look, all I see is what's gone.

So I can sit around and cry about how the world f*cking ended or...

I could start it up again.

And we offer that grilled on a bed of daily cut spinach.

Or you can have it roasted in our brick oven with fingerling potatoes.

The pasta is homemade agnolotti with veal ragout and we prepare that al dente.

Just a little brittleness to the bite.

And just to remind you, the chef requests no substitutions.

Can I get the pasta with the sauce on the side?

Yes, of course.

And can I get that without the brittleness to the bite?

That's not technically a substitution.

I'd be happy to ask.

Thanks.

That'd be great.

[laughing]

What?

Do you want to get out of here?

Out of the restaurant?

No.

Not the restaurant.

We just want to make sure you didn't pick up any unwanted guests along the way.

Here you go.

Thanks. Y'all got a reservation?

We rented a place in town.

Good for you.

Just need to see a copy of the lease and we'll let y'all on in.

Is this okay? We did it all online.

Yes, ma'am.

So you just take this to the rental desk at the visitor center.

It's just over the bridge.

They'll set your vehicle up with some stickers so you can drive on into town, okay?

Great. Thanks so much.

Man on P.A.: Welcome to Miracle National Park.

Nonresident vehicles are prohibited in Miracle.

Visitors must ride a shuttle bus to and from the center.

Come on, buddy.

...with their wristband before borders close.

Sir. Sir, you're gonna need to take that animal to quarantine if you're going into town.

What?

No one told us there was a quarantine.

Sir, it's right over there.

Rules are rules.

All right.

You go on in. I'll take him.

Okay.

60 days?

No wildlife admitted into the park until we can clear their blood work.

But it's not f*cking wildlife. It's a dog.

Here we go.

[dogs barking]

I will call you as soon as he can come home, but you're free to visit anytime.

I'll let you say your good-byes.

Come on. Come on.

It's okay. It's okay.

It's okay. It's all right.

Hey, come here.

Come here, buddy. It's all right.

Come here.

I know. I know. I know.

I'll be back.

I'll stay with him if you want.

Maybe he'll f*cking talk to me.

[barking echoes]

Welcome to Miracle National Park.

We're excited to have you.

Within the boundaries of the park sits the town of Jarden, a town with a unique history...

the most populous bordered area unaffected by the Sudden Departure.

All visitors access the park via Miracle Way.

There are shuttles from the visitor center every 30 minutes.

The visitor wristband is your ticket into Miracle.

Visitors must wear their wristband at all times.

Each wristband is valid between the hours of 8:00 A.M. and 7:00 P.M. on the day of issue.

Miracle isn't just a national park, it's a living, functioning town with a rich history.

That was true before October 14 and incredibly has remained true since.

The residents of Miracle request that you join them in the project of preserving this extraordinary place they call home by honoring these rules and regulations.

Once inside the park, you may purchase goods from any of Miracle's registered vendors.

As you explore our town, you'll notice that we've designated several areas as historical sites, each marked with a white reference number.

Most of these sites have been preserved exactly as they were...

Auction's in five minutes.

Oh, we've already rented a house.

I'm just looking for my family.

Temporary residential?

Right next to the day-pass line.

Thank you.

How are you?

Sorry?

How are you?

Fine, thanks.

I'm out on Leddecker Road.

Under the big oak.

Trailer with all the Christmas lights.

You should come see me anytime.

I can help you... with your situation.

Nora: That's unacceptable!

We drove here all the way from New York.

I can't believe this. This is unbelievable.

We paid a deposit. A $ 50,000 deposit.

What's going on?

They say our house b*rned down.

The house we rented?

Yes!

If you talk to the owner, maybe they...

We did it online. We don't know the owner.

Nora, calm down for one second.

Are there any other rentals available?

Not currently, but we'll get y'all to the top of the wait list should one come available.

When's that gonna be?

Hard to say.

Y'all were lucky to get one as easy as you did.

Lucky? Our entire house is in the back of a U-Haul.

You took our f*cking dog.

Well, I can make a call on over to quarantine.

See what I can do.

Dad!

[gavel pounds]

Auctioneer: 450,000 where?

I think she's buying a house.

Auctioneer: 500,000. 25 where?

500. Can I get five and a quarter? 25. Thank you.

525?

Man: 500.

Five, at 500. Now give me 525.

Five and a quarter. 525. And half.

Woman: Here.

 Now 600. Not 575. 600.

650!

I have you. I'm at 650.

750!

What are you doing?

Bidding.

Ladies and gentlemen, remember, there are no escrow.

All sales are final. On 750. 750. 800.

800!

I've got you at 800, ma'am.

Can we talk about this?

We talked about it when we committed to the rental.

That was for six months.

Okay? We're gonna take this one step at a time.

Our steps b*rned down.

Nora, you need to take a breath.

There's gonna be other chances.

How often do they have auctions?

That's the first one they've had this summer.

950!

I've got you at nine and a half.

One million.

I'm looking at a million dollars now.

We don't have to do this. There are other places that we can live.

This place.

This is the place we decided on.

Yeah, but...

You want to live here, buddy?

Yeah.

You in, Jill?

Yeah, I'm in if you guys are.

Three million.

[crowd gasps]

Ma'am, you realize the current bid is 1,600,000?

I understand that. Thank you.

All sales are final.

 We clear on that?

Yup.

Ladies and gentlemen, I have a $3 million bid on this house.

I'm at $3 million. Three one where?

I'm at three million now reeling three one.

Three million once.

Three million twice.

I have sold the house for $3 million.

We won!

Hey, we won.

Please don't take these off till you get your permanent resident cards.

It'll keep the rangers in town off your back.

Too tight?

No, it's fine. Thanks.

Once the wire transfer from your bank goes through, y'all can come pick up the keys.

Initial here and here.

Okay.

There's no hotels in the park, so y'all are gonna need to find other accommodations for tonight.

We don't need accommodations. We have family here.

[music playing on radio]

Think this is the right place?

Yup, he said the cottage next to the church.

Looks like a storage shed.

Matt: Hello?

Matt! It's us.

Oh!

You're here!

Oh! Hey, hey.

Hi.

Oh... my God, she's so big already.

Hey, I'm your Uncle Matt. Remember me?

[crying]

Oh. Okay, come in.

[laughing]

Mary will be happy to see you.

Let's go.

Hey, I'm glad you're here.

Me, too, Matt.

Come on.

All right.

Hi, Mary. How are you?

This is Lily. Can you say hi?

[Lily babbles]

Yeah.

[music continues]

I know it's not much, but we have our own bathroom.

And Reverend Massey, it's his church.

He and his wife let us use the kitchen in the main house whenever we want.

How was it coming into town?

The visitor center's something, huh?

It was, you know... they took our dog and they told us our rental b*rned down, but other than that, you know, smooth sailing.

What?

We were hoping we could stay with you guys tonight.

Oh, sure. Of course.

We're just a little short of space.

Oh, we have a tent.

Matt: $3 million?

That's almost exactly what I got for my place back home.

Weird, huh?

Yeah, it was meant to be.

I'm sure it's very nice.

We haven't actually seen it yet.

Guess that's why they call it a leap of faith.

Yeah, a leap of something.

You know, why don't you and Mary come stay with us for a while?

No. That's very generous, but I don't think it's a good idea.

You'd rather live in a garage than stay with us?

No, it's just I've been helping out at the church.

I should be close by.

What aren't you telling me?

He doesn't want to, Nora.

But why doesn't he want to?

He just told you. Let it go.

Oh, so you two bury a body together and now you got each other's backs, huh?

You told her?

Yeah. We tell each other everything.

Patti: Kevin.

I'm sorry I had to do that to you, but we just cannot go on with you treating me like I don't exist.

I do exist.

I need you to talk to me.

I just need you to talk... ah!

[thuds]

Kevin?

What happened?

Just... I slipped on some water.

I was checking the stove. There's got to be a leak.

You're bleeding.

I'm fine.

[knocking on door]

I'm fine.

Are you...

Go ahead and get that.

I have Band-Aids in my purse.

Okay, I got him.

Let's go answer the door.

Come on. Let's go see.

Feel like such a f*cking idiot.

That 'cause there's no water on the floor?

Well, I slipped on something.

Obviously.

Sit down.

Please don't put that on my head.

It'll clear out.

Ow, careful. Just be careful.

Don't be a baby.

[John and Nora chattering]

There you go. No more owie.

[door closes]

Hey, sweetie. [Murmurs]

Jill: Who was that?

Who was that?

Our new neighbor. You okay?

Mm-hmm.

You want to go to a birthday party?

No, no, no, no. It's... I b*rned it anyway.

They brought us a pie. It's on the kitchen counter.

Will you run and get it?

Oh, yeah. I'll be right back.

Pie is secure. Over.

What's wrong with you?

This was not the plan. This was not what it was supposed to be.

What was it supposed to be?

Not this.

Not spend all our money on a house that we've never even seen or been in.

We were supposed to try it out, see what happens.

And you went all f*cking in.

Why? For what?

[Lily crying]

She needs to be here 'cause it makes her feel safe.

Evie: You want me to lie?

Yes, I want you to lie.

Did you take your meds?

Yeah.

Sorry.

Erika: What about choir practice? You have a ride?

Mm-hmm.

What?

Ah, wait for your father.

I'm starving. Where is he?

Still in bed.

Oh, Jesus.

Why does he always sleep in this late?

Erika: Stop eating the bacon.

[clock ticking]

John.

John.

Evie: It really is amazing.

[kids laughing]

Shh.

Are you serious?

[all laugh]

What?

Man, get out of bed.

You gonna eat that bacon?

Maybe.

Maybe?

Maybe.

And what are the factors influencing your decision?

Leave his bacon alone.

Girl, if you made more, I wouldn't have to prey upon my children.

If I made more, your heart'd stop.

You can have some of mine.

Thank you.

I got an hour before I run my errands. You want to throw?

I have choir practice. Maybe when I get back?

[cricket chirps]

Oh!

You hear that?

[cricket chirps]

Oh!

That's it.

Please, not again.

Look, shh.

You're never gonna find it.

Shh, where was that?

Michael: By the dishwasher, I think.

No, no, it's not by the dishwasher.

It sounded like it came from the dishwasher.

Erika: It's definitely not by the...

Hey, if y'all keep talking...

I'm just saying it's not by the dishwasher.

Maybe it's in the ceiling.

You're not gonna find it.

I'm gonna find it.

Michael: Hey.

I got eggs and bacon.

There's a letter in there.

I'll take care of it.

[man speaking on megaphone]

Hey, how you doing, sir?

I'm good, I'm good. I'm in 121.

Okay, yeah. You can go ahead and set up over there.

Okay, thank you.

Thank you.

[man on megaphone] Just a reminder: you're now required to check in before you set up your stall.

Man: That's for $5.

How are you?

How y'all doing?

[man on megaphone] Just a reminder: you're now required to check in before you set your stalls up.

Folks, please make sure your vendor number is clear and visible at your stalls.

[man on megaphone] All right, folks. Two minutes.

We have two minutes till the first load.

[rumbling]

[glass rattling]

f*cking frackers.

At least it adds to our mystique.

All right, first bus coming in, everybody.

First bus coming in.

[honks horn]

[man on megaphone] All right, the first bus coming in, everybody.

First bus coming in.

[chatter]

Thank you, Lord.

Jesus.

Woman: Thank you, Jesus.

Woman #2: Thank Jesus.

Woman: Hallelujah. Thank you, God.

[speaks German]

How much?

It's whatever you want to give.

[speaking German]

[chuckles]

[speaking German]

This is a test?

No.

[speaking German]

Your water, will it make us safe?

It's just a souvenir.

[speaks German]

Church service is just past the 18 marker.

Services are an hour before the last bus leaves.

[both speaking German]

God bless you.

[chattering]

Woman: Hey!

Man: There's a line.

Man #2: People are waiting here.

I'll just be a minute.

How much is it?

Man: It's $140, if you don't mind.

[crying]

Hey, John.

Isaac.

Uh, didn't mean to interrupt.

Oh, no, it's all right. We were just finishing up.

It's all right.

And you remember, just after Thanksgiving, all right?

Thank you, Mr. Rainey.

Oh, oh...

[woman crying]

[door opens]

You thirsty? I got lemonade.

Uh, sounds good. Thanks.

Big line.

Seems like business is doing good.

I-I hear you're renting out your top floor.

Yeah, I filled all the paperwork out with park services and they said okay.

Well, if this is gonna be a two-family residence, fire code says upstairs needs a separate entrance and its own exterior stairwell.

Oh, uh, yeah, I can get all that done.

I just need a couple weeks.

Oh, no problem. As long as it happens.

So, uh, let's do this.

Sorry?

Your... your thing.

Can you do me?

Oh, you want a reading?

Yeah, a reading.

Okay. Yeah, sure.

Uh, you a lefty or righty?

All right.

Okay, try and focus all your energy into your hand and... rest your palm down into the paint and then press down as hard as you can on this here paper.

Yup.

Like that.

Good?

Yeah, yeah.

You can lift it.

Okay.

Yeah. Got some Wet-Naps there.

Thank you.

Paper towel.

It's a little messy.

[blow-dryer humming]

All right.

You got a good one.

Oh, good.

[exhales]

[sighs]

You got a birthday coming up?

Yeah, day after tomorrow.

Oh, happy birthday.

Thanks.

Yeah.

[exhales]

What?

Nothing.

No, come on.

What?

Uh, nothing, man.

I'm not getting anything off you.

Tell me.

Something bad is gonna happen.

To you.

Well, shit, Isaac.

That is not ideal.

[glasses clatter]

Look, I know why you're here, John.

Yeah, listen, you and me have known each other since the third grade, huh?

Now, in all those times, you've never once mentioned to me that you had superpowers.

I don't have superpowers.

Well, magic powers.

Come on, man.

It's just the two of us talking.

You and me.

Now, this... it's all bullshit, right?

[sighs]

I don't know what you want me to tell you.

I want you to tell me the truth.

John, what I do... is real.

Ah, well...

I got to respect that.

Oh, and... how much do I owe you?

No, man, it's on the house.

No, no.

60 enough?

Hey, John.

Be careful.

[chuckles] Yeah, I sure will.

You're gonna need stitches.

I can do it myself or I can refer you to a plastic surgeon in Austin.

I was born here.

I have a right to be here.

When did he start burning people's houses down?

Tonight.

You were who you said you were, you should have seen it coming.

Yeah, well, you tell your husband I meant what I said.

Michael: A reading from Thessalonians.

""Now we ask you, brothers, to give recognition to those who labor among you and lead you in the Lord and admonish you.""

Congregation: Yes. Yes.

""And regard them very highly in love because of their work.

Be at peace among yourselves.""

Yes. Yes.

""Comfort the discouraged.""

Yes!

""Help the weak.""

Yes!

""Be patient with everyone.""

All right.

""See to it that no one repays evil for evil to anyone.

But always pursue what is good.""

Yes!

That's right.

""For one another and for all.""

Yes!

Hallelujah!

This is the word of the Lord.

Yes!

We are the 9,261.

We are spared.

All: We are spared.

And for that, we are grateful.

All: Amen!

Thank you, Michael.

Just a reminder for y'all, I'm up in Austin this week getting my surgery.

So if you are so inclined, ask of the Lord for competent doctors.

Yes!

And a powerful anesthesia.

[applause]

So I'll miss a few sermons.

But just like my hip, y'all will get a great replacement.

All right.

That's right.

Met him doing some missionary work down in Brazil.

He don't know our style...

That's all right.

...but he knows the Good Book.

Amen, amen.

Better than most.

Certainly better than me.

My friend Matt Jamison.

[applause]

Thank you, Reverend Massey.

I'm so grateful for your kindness and for letting me be here.

I haven't had the pleasure of meeting most of you yet.

We've... My wife Mary and I have only been here for a month or so.

Well, I'm a man of faith.

Amen!

But when I heard about this place, when I heard about what happened here, I'd be lying if I told you I understood it.

Yes, yes.

But I understand it now.

[applause]

Because you've shared your home with me, I want to share with you what has happened to us, to Mary, who I was told by countless doctors would never recover.

Thank you, Matt.

We all know what a truly special place we've got here.

Yes!

Massey: And I know I speak for everyone here when I say, welcome, brother.

Welcome!

Welcome, sister.

Praise Jesus.

Amen!

Now let us bow our heads for a reading from the Gospel of Luke.

So nice to have you.

Thank you.

Matt: Hi.

Massey: Thank you, sir. Thank you.

John. So nice to see your face in there today.

What you talking about, now? Come on, now, Calvin.

You're gonna make the new reverend here think I never come to church.

[both laugh]

John Murphy.

John, nice to meet you.

Matt Jamison, my wife Mary.

A pleasure, Mary.

Welcome to Jarden.

Now, where you two in from?

Mapleton, New York. It's just outside the city.

New York City.

Ah, figured.

[laughs]

Yeah.

So what were you gonna say up there?

I'm sorry?

Well, right before Calvin here cut you off.

Seemed like you were about to share something about your wife.

Oh. [chuckles]

I was just gonna say that I felt a burden lift off of us when we came to your town.

For the first time in a long time, we feel safe.

Well, there's no place in the world safer.

Y'all take care.

Thank you.

Mm-hmm.

[music playing]

[music continues]

[chattering]

Sorry, I asked for the bacon on a separate plate.

You got it. I'll bring that right back for you.

Every time.

Well, it wouldn't be every time if they'd listen, sweetheart.

""See to it that no one repays evil for evil to anyone.""

Any particular reason you picked that one?

I didn't pick it. Readings are predetermined.

What is a Thessalonian anyway?

Someone from Thessalonia.

From Arkansas, right?

[all laugh]

Bacon and eggs separated.

Appreciate it.

Jerry, come on.

Narrator: ""Perfect Strangers"" star Mark Linn-Baker departed on October 14, 2012, but ""Hard 10"" tracked him down to this sleepy village in the Chihuahua province of Mexico.

Woman: We know you didn't depart, Mark.

Why'd you fake your departure?

No comprende. No comprende.

Woman: We know it's you, Mark.

Mark: No Mark. No Mark esta.

Woman: Mark, tell us why you did it. Tell us why.

Damn! Damn it!

Narrator #2 on TV: They're gone, but so much of them is still here.

You've tried to move on, tried to live a normal life, but cannot let go because you haven't known how.

[spoon rattling]

Michael: Hey.

[gasps]

Uh... my spoon got stuck in the garbage disposal.

I'm going for a ride.

Other people feed him, you know.

He likes Mom's cooking.

Back by 10:00.

Be safe.

[cricket chirps]

[door closes]

You mail the letter?

Uh-huh.

Good night.

Man: Get off me! Hey, we just missed the bus.

Officer: Sure, you did. Head down, sir.

Ma'am, calm down.

You can't keep us out.

Calm down, ma'am.

f*ck you, man. This is f*cking America.

[Taser crackles]

Ah!

Man: You can't keep people out, man.

You're not so special. f*ck your f*cking wristbands!

[TV playing]

Hello.

Hi.

You want to pray?

Okay.

[vehicle approaches]

[music playing]

What's that?

It's a pie.

Where'd it come from?

It was on the porch.

Is it for your birthday?

I don't know.

There wasn't a note?

Just a pie.

Hmm.

What kind is it?

Apple, I think.

Looks homemade.

Mm-hmm.

You think someone's trying to poison you?

[laughs] Look at your face.

[laughs]

You know someone just moved in the Dunbar house.

A family.

Just now?

Mm-hmm. Seem nice.

I think we ought to invite them over for dinner tonight.

You're gonna work on your birthday?

Just being neighborly.

Hi.

Hey.

Saw you moving in. I'm John Murphy.

We're right next door.

Here. Welcome.

Oh, thanks. That's so nice. I'm Nora.

Well, I see you got your hands full.

No problem. I got her. Did you bake this yourself, John?

No, ma'am, I did not.

And who's this?

This is Lily. Say hello to Mr. Murphy, Lily.

[coos]

Hey, Lily.

[banging]

Is everything all right in there?

Fine, we're just moving in. You know, chaos.

Of course. Well, I'll leave you to it.

Just wanted to invite you all over tonight.

Having a little barbecue for my birthday.

That's so... We don't want to crash your birthday.

No, no pressure. Just drop by if you can.

Thank you.

Bye-bye.

Bye, Lily.

You ask them if they eat meat?

I told them it was a barbecue.

If they don't eat meat, that would have been the time to tell me.

Violet wants to know when she can pick me up.

Well, you tell Violet that you will text her as soon as I authorize you to do so.

Nora: Hello!

Sorry, we rang the doorbell, but nobody answered.

We're back here. Come on down.

It's Kevin. You're John, right?

Right. Right. This is Erika.

Hi. Hi.

Hi, Erika. How are you? Nice to meet you.

Evie, Michael, introduce yourselves.

How you doing?

Michael.

I'm Nora.

Nice to meet you.

Hi.

Hey.

So are we early, or...

No, right on time.

Oh, I thought this was a birthday party.

It is. We don't have any friends.

[laughing]

Erika: Who is this?

Nora: This is Lily.

Erika: Well, hello, Lily.

[laughter, chattering]

♪ I don't need sunglasses ♪

♪ Ain't no sun without you, baby... ♪

She's adorable.

Thank you.

Is she adopted or did your mom f*ck a black dude?

Evie!

[laughs]

[laughs]

You don't need that anymore.

You guys bought the house, right?

Yeah, but they said that we should leave them on for a couple weeks so the park rangers don't bother us or something.

Your daughter is good with a baby.

That's got to be nice.

Oh, she's not mine. She's Kevin's.

Oh, well, she's pretty.

So is he.

His secret is moisturizing.

[laughs]

So you have family around here?

Sorry?

In Jarden.

I figured someone must have tipped you off about the house.

Real estate moves pretty quick around here.

Oh, no, we were just in the right place at the right time.

I have a brother, Matt Jamison.

He and his wife came out here a couple months ago.

He's helping out in the Baptist church. You know him?

I just met him yesterday. Small world.

Kevin: Cake looks good.

Well, she works the grill, I bake.

[laughs]

Now, what happened to your head?

I fell.

Can I... can I put these in the fridge?

Absolutely.

You want one?

Uh, nah. I don't drink.

But help yourself.

Okay.

What?

What? What?

Oh, what were you looking at?

I was just looking at your couch in the other room.

We had one just like it.

[can pops]

[laughter]

So I step on the carpet and I feel this squish.

I walk around the corner and trickling down the steps like a fancy fountain is water, but in my house.

[laughing]

So I'm walking up these steps.

And you know when you feel like it's a bad idea, but you do it anyway?

I open the bathroom door and this wave comes out.

A little one, but a wave.

And this one is standing in the bathtub with her arms out like Moses and this one's up on the sink trying his hardest not to get wet.

And he just looks at me with this serious face and goes, ""Evie wanted to know what would happen.""

[laughing]

Gets funnier every time, Mama.

Nora: How old were they?

Five.

And they're lucky they made it to six.

That must have been fun to come home to.

Well, I was in prison.

Oh, yeah? Well, how long were you there for?

Six years, 119 days.

[chuckles]

They think you're kidding.

Oh, sorry, no. I really was.

Travis County Unit.

Go ahead.

Go ahead and ask.

What?

What I did. It's what everybody wants to know.

Oh, that's none of our business.

What'd you do?

Huh.

What happened?

Well, didn't try hard enough.

This doesn't happen unless she forgets to take her meds.

Sorry. I-I ruined your cake.

No, no, no, no. It's... I burnt it anyway.

No.

The pie! They brought us a pie.

It's on the kitchen counter. Will you run and get it?

Yep. Yeah, I'll grab it.

Thank you for stopping by.

I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Kevin.

Yeah, me, too.

Bye.

Uh, see you later.

Don't open it till I'm gone, okay?

[Vehicle approaches rapidly]

Sorry. I got lost comin' off the highway.

I tried to call you.

The battery on my phone died.

Where is she?

What are you doing?

I'm closing her eyes.

You can't touch her.

Why not?

Because she's... it's a f*ck' crime scene.

You told me on the phone she did this to herself.

No one's gonna f*ck' believe that.

I believe it.

I brought her here.

I b*at her. I tied her up...

And then you tried to let her go, but she wouldn't let that happen.

She wanted you to pay.

She knew if she did this that it'd hurt you...

'cause you're a good man, Kevin.

If you touch her... we're in this together.

Then let's be in it.

I have shovels in my trunk.

Wait. [Sighs]

I, uh...

I marked a passage.

Oh. OK.

What?

You should read it.

Oh, no. No, thanks.

Why not?

Because I don't believe it, Matt.

I'm sure she didn't, either.

Did you ask for my help, Kevin?

Yes.

This is me helping.

Just the highlighted part.

It can get wordy.

""If I go to the East, He is not there.

If I go to the West, I do not find Him.

When He is at work in the North, I do not see Him.

When He turns to the South, I catch no glimpse of Him.

But He knows the way that I take.""

""When He has tested me, I will come forth as gold.""

""My feet have closely followed His steps and have kept to His way without turning aside.

I have not departed... ""

""Not departed from the commandment of His lips.

I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.""

""But He stands alone, and who can oppose Him?""

""He does whatever He pleases.

He carries out His decree against me, [Voice cracks] and many such plans He still has in store.""

[Sniffles, sobs]

""That is why I am terrified before Him.""

""When I think of all this, I fear Him.

God has made my heart faint.""

""The Almighty has terrified me.""

""Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.""

Amen.

I brought you a change of clothes.

[Sighs] Pardon the fashion. They're donated.

I'm not supposed to be here!

[Pounding on door]

This is a mistake!

[Pounds on door]

I'm not f*cking crazy!

Just calm down. Calm down. Stay calm.

You're OK. Just calm down.

Stay calm. You're OK.

Just calm down. Stay calm. You're OK.

Just calm down. Stay calm. You're OK.

[Knock knock knock]

Just calm...

[Door locks]

[Door unlocking]

You gonna behave yourself?

Yeah.

Man on TV: I had to ask.

[Audience laughter on TV]

Ten minutes.

[Laughter on TV]

Man on TV: Do you usually sleep on that side?

Well, why don't I go to that side? No, no.

I will go to that side of the bed.

Balki, I don't mind sleeping on that side of the bed.

I'm not arguing about sleeping on that side of the bed.

Hey, baby boy.

Have a seat.

Dad, I need to get to a phone.

Jill hasn't heard from me. I got to call...

Shh, shh, shh, shh.

[Sighs]

Quiet... at last.

[Sniffs]

[Sighs]

So you finally f*ck' snapped, huh?

No.

No?

I'm not f*cking crazy.

Neither am I... but I am a bad man, son, and the bad men end up here.

Dad, you're... look, you're a good man.

I most definitely am not.

My intentions are good, but my heart and my mind and my balls, son, the holy f*ck' Trinity... they all knew.

That night 3 years ago, we looked at ourselves in the mirror, and none of us wondered why we were still f*ck' here.

We knew.

Of course we knew.

You know.

I don't belong here.

Yeah, you do.

No, I don't.

Oh, yes, you...

I have to leave here.

There is no leaving here. Now...

Don't you f*cking dare!

Do not turn around.

No, no, just get the f*ck out of here.

Son, I said do not turn around.

Patti: f*ck him.

Turn around.

Hello again.

Now, why'd you go and do that?

He needs to get out, and you weren't helping, you crazy, dried-up, f*ck' turd.

Oh, f*ck you, you f*ck' tobacco-stink twat.

He needs to stay.

Is that what you need, Kevin?

This isn't happening.

This isn't real.

You're not here.

It's happenin'.

It's real.

I'm here.

Mmm.

You... you're dead.

You're f*cking dead.

I buried you.

Hmm.

Not... deep...

[Whispers] enough.

[Whimpers]

Hey, you leave with her... you leave with her.

Dad. Daddy.

Now, Kevin, shh.

Looks like we're gonna be traveling companions.

Until then...

[Whispers] you should wake the f*ck up.

What?

Wake the f*ck up!

You OK?

Yeah.

Fine.

Where are we?

I got hungry.

Want a cheeseburger?

Matt: Mmm.

Mmm.

God, that's good.

So what'd she say?

Who?

Patti.

What'd she say before she k*ll herself?

I don't want to talk about it.

I can't help if you don't tell me.

You've helped me enough, Matt.

Not you. Them. The Remnant.

You can't help them.

Yes, I can. I know I can 'cause I'm supposed to. But you need to tell me why she did what she did. You need to tell me what she said.

She said... I understand.

Understood what?

I don't know.

Sure you do.

Excuse me?

If she wanted to deliver a message by cutting her own throat, I'm pretty sure she'd be confident you received it before she did. So what did you understand?

Why we didn't go. Why... we're still here.

Tell me.

Before it happened, the, uh, the 14th? I wanted to leave. I wanted to be free of, uh... my family.

Wanting and doing aren't the same.

I slept with another woman.

Who?

I don't know her name. She, uh... she disappeared.

You were... with her? At the moment of the Departure?

Yeah.

No shit? What happened next?

I don't really remember all of it. I think I was in shock.

Phones were down, and, um, I was... wearing my uniform. And people kept coming up to me and asking me for help. And I couldn't... or I... I didn't know how. So I got in my car... and I went to Jill's school and I ran inside. She and Tommy were both there, and... they were scared. I just remember the look on their faces when they saw me. Um... They were so... they were... they were so happy. [Sobbing] They were happy.

[Crying] And, uh... we went back to the house, and Laurie had already gone home, so... and she was different. I mean, I think we all were. But I just wanted to be with them. And I wanted to hold them. And then I started to lose them. [Sobbing] One by one.

It's not your fault.

Yes, it is. It is. [Sniffles]


[Door opens]

[Turns off water]

[Man crying]

Oh...

[Sobbing quietly]

[Knocks on door]

Hey, you OK?

[Panting]

[Mumbling]

Jesus Christ.

Just sitting here. Too many woes.

Listen, don't move.

Please, what's your name?

Kevin. You need help.

Kevin.

No, Kevin, Kevin, I'm gonna be dead in a minute.

There's no help for me.

[Wayne grunts]

So, please, don't leave me alone.

[Wayne sighs]

Sure.

Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

I'm right here.

Thank you.

Will you do something for me?

A favor... stranger to stranger?

Will you... will you make a wish?

A what?

I think I may be a fraud.

But... but if... if I'm not, I can give you anything you want... and... [groans]... that will mean I was real.

Let me do this f... for you before I go. Make a wish.

You don't have to say it out loud. Just think it.

Oh.

Granted.

[Running footsteps approach]

Man: ATFEC! Get down! Get the f*ck down! Now!

Get on the ground now! Hurry up! Get down!

Stay the f*ck down! Let's go! Come on, turn around!

Let's go!

Stay down!

Go!

[Handcuffs clicking]

[Sirens]

[Police radio chatter]

What did he say to you?

Uh... just asked me my name.

That's it?

Yeah, that's it.

Talk to you about Russia?

No.

Make any physical contact with you?

Why?

Did he?

No.

[Siren]

Who was he?

[Sighs]

Just another assh*le who thought he was God.

Matt: Excuse me. This man did nothing wrong.

We were just having lunch, and he's a police officer, a chief.

You're a cop?

Yeah.

Why didn't you say so?

I'm off-duty.

Where you from?

New York, uh, Mapleton.

OK, we're good here, Chief. Thanks for your cooperation.

Go on home to Mapleton.

Man: Stop, now! You...

[Brakes screech]

[g*n]

Hey! Drop the g*n!

Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's OK.

Calm down.

Drop the g*n.

[Panting]

What's your name?

What?

Drop the g*n. We can talk about whatever you want to talk about.

Listen, I'm a cop.

Do you... do you see what they did?!

It's all right. Calm down. Just drop the g*n.

f*ck you!

[Distant shouting, g*n]

Hey!

Woman: I'll k*ll you, f*ck!

[Distant g*n]

Hey!

Kevin!

[Distant glass shattering]

Kevin: Jesus Christ.

Can you hear me?

What happened?

What happened?

What the f*ck did you people do?

She's hurt!

She wants to be f*ck' hurt!

[Distant g*n and screaming]

What happened?

[Distant shouting]

[Brakes screech]

Man: I'm gonna k*ll you!

♪

Jesus. Lucy. Lucy!

You all right?

You were right.

You were right.

[Distant g*n]

Dennis: Please!

Go back to your homes, for your own safety!

Dennis!

Chief!

They have not...

Where the f*ck is everybody?!

I can't stop them! They left!

Give me a f*ck' g*n.

[Sighs]

Where's all the fire trucks?

I called them.

They want to wait till the roads clear.

Well, then you clear the f*ck' cars out of the g*dd*mn road so they can get in!

Chief, nobody wants to help them!

Get out of my way!

It's their own fault.

Listen, go back to that f*ck'... stay at this barricade and do not let anyone through, do you understand?

Go!

Dennis: Step back! Hold it.

Hold this f*ck' line. Step the f*ck back!

How dare you?!

[Crying]

Aah!

Oh! [Groans]

Hey, I'll get you somewhere safe.

I'll get you somewhere safe.

[Crying] J... Ji...

Huh?

Jill!

[Dialogue muted]

[Jill coughing]

You OK?

It's all right. It's all right.

Nora (voice-over): ""Dear Kevin, I need to say good-bye to someone I care about, someone who's still here, so I'm saying it to you. You were good to me, Kevin, and sometimes when we were together, I remembered who I used to be before everything changed. But I was pretending, pretending as if I hadn't lost everything.

I want to believe it can all go back to the way it was. 

I want to believe that I'm not surrounded by the abandoned ruin of a dead civilization. I want to believe it's still possible to get close to someone... but it's easier not to.

It's easier because I'm a coward and I couldn't take the pain, not again. I know that's not fair, Kevin. You've lost so much, too, and you're strong. You're still here. But I can't be, not anymore. I tried to get better, Kevin.

I didn't want to feel this way, so I took a shortcut. But it led me right back home, and do you know what I found when I got there? I found them, Kevin, right where I left them. Right where they left me. It took me 3 years to accept the truth, but now I know there's no going back, no fixing it. I'm beyond repair. Maybe we're all beyond repair.

I can't go on the way I'm living... but I don't have the power to die.

But I have to move towards something. Anything. I'm not sure where I'm going, just away.

Away from all this. I think about a place where nobody will know what happened to me. But then I worry I'll forget them. I don't ever want to forget them. I can't. They were my family. I think I loved you, Kevin.

Maybe you loved me, too. I wish I could say this to you instead of writing it. I wish I could see you one last time to thank you and wish you well and tell you how much you mean to me. But I can't. Like I said, I'm a coward. So, wish me luck. Heh! [Sniffles] I think I'm going to need it. Love, Nora.""

Hi.

[Baby cooing]

[Voice trembles] Look what I found."

This for tomorrow?

Uh, yeah, I'm sure.

You know, that's my other line, so... ok.

Ok, ok.

Ok, goodbye. [Hangs up phone]

Hello?

Oh, hi.

No, I have appointments all day.

Woman: Oh, yeah, we can set up ourselves.

How many chairs?

Oh, great, great.

Ok.

Ok, I'll see you after 4:00, then.

Thanks. Bye.

Laurie: Hey, Jill?

Come on, honey. Chop, chop.

They pushed my afternoon sessions so I can meet the rental guys.

All you have to do is get the cake.

Yeah, ok. Do you think he knows?

No. Why?

Jill, I'm waiting!

Hey, when does Tommy get back?

Said he had a morning class and he'd come after that.

All right.

So I'll see you at noon.

You have the breeder's address?

The what?

The breeder?

For the puppy?

Oh. It has to be today?

Yeah, we have to go today; Otherwise we go on the wait list and lose our deposit.

All right, ok. Noon. I'll be there.

[Jill singing]

Have a good day. [Chuckling]

[Jill continues singing]

I love you.

Love you, too.

Mmm.

[Running footsteps]

[Child giggles]

Oh, don't. Please?

Mommy attack! Oh.

Jeremy: Yeah!

Oh, yeah, way too early.

[Bubba barking] Oh, God.

Oh, way too early, guys. Way too early.

Good morning.

Good morning. [Kiss]

Doug: Oh, hi.

Oh, mwah.

Hi, hi.

I love you.

[Nora and Doug laugh]

[Microwave beeps]

Erin: My bunny is really soft and...

[Bubba yipping]

Its ears are, like, this big, and it's pretty big...

[Erin chattering]

Nora: Get your hand out of the box, miss.

Erin: And he also eats carrots.

No.

Jeremy.

Don't feed the dog.

[Bubba whining]

Jeremy: Hey, dad.

Yo!

You look nice.

Today's my interview.

Today's your interview.

You said you could take the kids to school.

Of course I'm taking the kids to school, right, kids?

Jeremy: What's an interview?

Mommy's getting a job.

Trying to get a job.

Do you want it?

[Sets down coffee pot]

Yeah, I do.

Then you're gonna get it.

Come on.

Mmm! Mommy's gettin' a job!

Kids: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah...

Doug: Hey! Mommy!

Doug and kids: Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

[Sighs]

Hello?

Woman: Laurie, hi. Dr. Singley. How are you?

Oh, hi. Fine.

I was told you canceled your appointment?

Yeah, yeah, my daughter has a science fair and I wanted to...

I really think it's important for you to come in tomorrow.

We're reaching the point of no return.

I know. I just...

I...

I need to talk to my husband.

Well, you should do that.

And then you'll be in tomorrow?

Yes.

Good. See you then.

[Hangs up, sets down phone]

Good morning.

Patti, you ready to come in?

[Giggling]

It's a cat?

Yeah. Ha ha ha!

But it has a pop tart for its body, and it's just sh**ting through space and it has rainbows coming out of its butt and it's just really happy about it.

[Giggling]

I don't get it.

No, dad, you don't.

[Giggling]

Kevin: Yeah, and come home straight after school.

Your mom and I need help setting up for the party.

Uh, he knows, you know.

It's not gonna be a surprise.

Yeah, I know, I know. Just please don't tell your mom.

[Kiss]

You smell like cigarettes.

What?

Bye.

[School bell rings]

[Distant train whistle blowing]

[Distant kids screaming]

[Distant adults yelling]

What happened?

I don't know. They just all came running out.

Girl: It's a monster!

[Children crying and screaming]

[Door opens]

Woman: Is it gone?

What was it?

It... it was a deer.

[Ticking]

Uh...

I think something terrible's about to happen.

Tell me what that feels like.

What it feels like?

Yeah.

I mean...

Why is this time different?

Because you've said this before, and we're still here.

Those times... they were like... tremors.

This...

This is the big one...

Like the world is gonna end.

Then tell me how it feels.

Like a hand is inside my chest...

And it's squeezing my heart... tighter and tighter, and he won't let me go until it's over.

""He""?

What?

""He"" won't let go?

[Scoffs] It's not about that.

It isn't?

No, no.

It's not about Neil telling you to leave your own house?

He paid for it.

It's his house.

That's... not how it works, Patti.

But he told you to go, so you went.

And all those abusive things he said to you?

That's what makes you feel like the world is ending.

Because instead of ignoring those things, you... you believe them.

You absorb them.

Well, I guess I better shit 'em back out.

Maybe you should.

Maybe you should put them in a bag and write Neil's name on it and just... drop it right back off on his doorstep.

Come on.

Well, if it'll stop the world from ending, why the hell not?

Nothing's going to stop that.

I know why you're tellin' jokes, 'cause you can feel it, too, can't you?

I know you can.

Something's wrong... inside you.

Sorry, Patti, that's just not true.

There's nothing wrong with me.

Well, you're on the council, but nobody knows who you are.

Buddy Menlo is the incumbent. He's popular, he has built-in name recognition, and we're a month out from the election, so if I'm being honest, barring a miracle, I don't think you stand a chance.

Uh-huh.

And why should I hire you if you can't help me win?

Because I think you have some progressive ideas for the town...

Oh, f*ck my progressive ideas.

Why do you want to do this, uh...

Nora Durst?

Because...

I want to use my brain for more than figuring out which juice box is certified organic.

I want...

I need something for myself.

I know I'm not running for mayor of New York City, but for the next 4 weeks, I need this to be your priority.

And what does that mean for the, um... juice boxes?

As far as you're concerned, for the next 4 weeks, I don't have a family.

Councilwoman.

I'm in the middle of an interview.

You comin' to my thing tonight?

You're not supposed to know you're having a thing tonight.

And yet I do know. You comin' or not?

I'm in the middle of an interview.

Hey.

You tell her she could b*at buddy?

Nope.

Hire her.

Now get the f*ck out of here, man of the year.

We're, uh, just friends, so...

Moorland, you've got first and Broadway, and don't any of you think you dodged a b*llet 'cause you'll all be getting traffic control until Con Ed's done with the gas lines, which should be in about a week.

Now, in other good news... or bad news... this heat wave's gonna continue, so water restriction is still in place, which means you issue a ticket to anybody who's sprinkling their lawns between 6:00 and 10:00 and it looks like we've got ourselves a deer problem.

Reports of the f*ck gettin' stuck inside buildings.

One wandered into the biggie superstore, another jammed through Rosalie Darmody's baby shower...

Think it's just one.

Sorry?

Deer. I think it's just one.

Oh, why do you think that?

I saw it this morning.

At the school?

No, I just missed it at the school. Before that.

Lou: Just a theory, chief... maybe this thing's in heat and just wants to f*ck the lieutenant.

[Scattered laughter]

f*ck you, Lou.

Kevin Sr.: It doesn't matter to me if it's deer singular or deer f*ck' plural.

You are authorized to put it down.

Well, we don't need to k*ll it.

If it's dangerous and unstable, yes, we do.

We get tranq g*n from animal control.

If we see it, we knock it out, bring it back to the woods, let it go.

Let it go?

Yes.

Ok, I'll make you a deal.

You get a tranq g*n, I'll have dispatch inform you of any sightings, and you get there before anyone with an actual w*apon?

Hallelujah.

Set Bambi free.

Good?

Yes, good.

Fantastic.

Now, I hope to not see any of you any time soon, especially tonight, as I hate f*ck' parties.

Dismissed.

[Overlapping chatter]

[Cell phone vibrating]

Hello?

Tom: Dad.

Tommy, you ok?

I think I f*cked up.

Where are you?

[Police radio static]

Man: He's mostly sobered up.

Guy's not pressing charges.

He will if there's a next time.

I appreciate it.

No problem.

Come on.

[Tom sighs, sniffles]

Sorry.

Glad you called me.

[Handcuffs clicking]

Thank you.

Anytime.

Hey. Come on. It's ok.

[Hisses] Ah!

[Exhales sharply, sniffles]

What did he do?

This the house?

Please don't. It was my fault. Dad...

It's ok. Gonna talk to him.

Would you get your dad for me, please?

Yeah?

Shit.

You know who I am?

Look, man, he keeps coming here.

What happened?

He was drunk.

This is the third time. I already told him...

What happened?

He doesn't understand that this is not something that I'm interested in.

Did you touch him?

He tried to come into my house.

Did you touch him?

All I did was push him back... [Groans]

If you touch my kid again, I will f*ck' k*ll you.

[Breathing heavily]

It... it's ok.

[Car door closes]

Why'd you have to tell me?

Your mother thought it would be the same as lying if we didn't.

I'm your father, not him.

I know.

Why do you need to keep doing this?

Because he shouldn't get to pretend like it never happened.

He did a terrible thing to you and your mother.

Sometimes you have to pretend.

[Puppies yapping]

Well, well, looks like someone chose you.

Is that the mother?

Mm-hmm. Her third litter.

Oh.

They seem so young to be away from her.

It's actually completely natural.

They don't need her anymore.

[Cell phone chimes]

I'm sorry.

It's my husband.

He's not coming.

Just bring him home.

I promise, the minute your husband sees him, he'll fall in love.

Tsk. Sorry.

[Whispers] They're wonderful, aren't they?

Laurie: Hey, Jill, honey, you got to clear off the table.

The food's gonna be here, and I need to set up.

Almost done.

Want me to help you?

No, thanks.

So, I, uh, I know you have your presentation tomorrow, and I really want to be there, but, uh, I have an appointment, and I tried to...

That's ok. You weren't there last year.

I'm a terrible mother.

There's no need to be dramatic.

I'm not being dramatic.

[Scoffs] Come here!

You're the best mom in the whole world.

Ha ha!

The best mom ever!

Kevin: Hello-o!

Mwah! Tell mom she's the best.

Well, she is the best.

Where's the cake?

Right behind me.

Jill: Oh!

Aah!

Ha ha ha! You're home.

Oh! Oh!

Hey, what are you two doing together?

The car broke down, so I went and picked him up.

Yeah. [Snaps fingers]

Lookin' good, Billy Ray!

Ha ha ha!

Feeling good, Louis.

Laurie: Ok, team. Time to party.

Up.


[Radio static]

Man on radio: Silver fox approaching the door. Repeat, silver fox approaching.

Kevin: Copy that.

[Overlapping chatter] He's here.

Uh, all right. Everyone, get down, get down.

[Doorbell rings]

He's here. And quiet, stay quiet.

Lou: He knows.

Oh, f*ck off, Lou.

Kevin's out back, making some drinks.

You can just head through the kitchen.

All: Surprise!

Oh, oh! Ha ha ha!

f*ck.

Hey.

Hey, Tommy. Come here, college boy!

Tom: Man hug!

Man hug! Man hug!

Aah!

Hey, Mary, how you doing?

Thank you so much for coming.

He was so surprised!

I think he was.

Hey, Jill.

You need to take that over to the bar, honey.

Who picked this music?

Old people. Take it to the bar.

[Lou chuckling]

Lucy: Beautiful house.

Kevin, your wife must do very well for herself.

Oh, well, f*ck you very much. Ha ha!

You better not talk to me like that when I'm mayor.

Oh, I'm sure. I won't.

Ok!

Lou: Wait, wait. He didn't tell you about the deer?

What deer?

The one that your husband wants to rescue and free back into the wilderness.

Apparently, they've got a very special relationship.

It's confused.

It just keeps trapping itself inside of buildings. It's...

Aw. Poor thing.

Thank you, God, for mommy and daddy...

Jeremy: Hiyah!

Kylie and Bubba.

Jeremy, stop.

Prayers are stupid.

Don't say that.

Go pick out a book. I'll come read to you in 10 minutes, ok?

[Kiss]

Come on. Up.

Maybe it lost its family.

Who did?

The deer.

Maybe it's looking for them at our school.

Maybe, but he's not gonna come back ever again, ok? I promise. You're safe.

Good night, my love.

'Night, mommy.

You can turn it all the way.

Are you sure?

I'm not scared anymore.

[Door closes downstairs]

[Footsteps ascend]

[Sighs] Long day.

You said 6:00.

One of the accounts fell apart.

I can come home early tomorrow.

Did I miss the window?

No, go on in. She's still up.

Fantastic.

It went great.

My interview?

Awesome.

So the Honorable Judge Hader sidles up to me before the ceremony.

He's there every year, like he invented the f*ck' thing.

[Lou laughing]

Kevin Sr.: And he says, ""congratulations on this great honor.""

So I looked that cocksucker right in the eyes and said, ""can't be that great.

They gave one to you.""

[Laughter]

Everybody? Everybody.

If I may, on behalf of the Civic Clergy Association, I feel obligated to share with you... why I nominated our guest of honor for Mapleton Man of the Year.

Matt: The answer?

I couldn't nominate myself.

[Laughter]

Matt: But seriously, this man, well, he's humble, he's gracious, he doesn't like me saying how generous he is or what he's done for the church, what he's done for me or the people of this town.

Yeah. Yeah.

But, hell, I just did. [Laughter]

Hail to the chief.

All: Hail to the chief!

[Scattered applause]

Woman: Hear, hear.

Uh, this is a part of something that chief used to read to me when I was a kid.

Kevin: Ahem.

A man said to the universe, ""Sir, I exist.""

""However,"" the universe replied, ""the fact has not created in me a sense of obligation.""

A lot of people think that the world owes them something.

But you, dad, you built your life... and mine on your own.

Now look at me, you know, and look what I got.

Guests: Mmm.

Man: Yeah.

To family.

Yeah. Yeah.

All: To family!

Whoo!

Whoa!

[Dialogue fades out]

You're just askin' to get caught.

Oh, shit.

[Chuckles]

Thought you quit.

Takin' a break from quitting.

[Exhales sharply]

That was a beautiful speech.

I almost believed you meant it.

[Sighs]

I think something's f*ck' wrong with me.

I think you're right.

Why isn't it enough?

[Sighs]

Because every man rebels against the idea that this is f*ck' it.

Fights windmills, saves f*ck' damsels, all in search of greater purpose.

You have no greater purpose...

Because it is enough.

[Sighing]

I feel like I have the same conversation 80 f*ck' times a day.

I have no idea what you mean.

Sit.

[Clears throat]

So, uh, you ready for your panel, whatever, at drop?

Yes, sir. They put me on day two, along with Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Just don't let them bully you into taking questions about the data.

All right, they gave us a pass last year, but they're gonna want answers this time.

""I'm sorry, sir or madam, I'm not qualified ""to analyze the data from our questionnaires.

I don't even have access to it before it goes to our statisticians in Annapolis.""

Oh, shit.

Annapolis. Speaking of, what are you doing on 121?

What?

I just got this email.

""Please inquire ID 42ECN as to the manner by which he/she presents question 121.""

What are you doing?

Ok.

I'm not doing anything.

It says here you're 100% affirmative.

Every single one of your applicants answers 121 ""yes.""

Isn't that what we're supposed to be looking for, a pattern?

Everyone else who ask the questions get plenty of ""Nos.""

It's only a pattern for you.

Maybe you're, um...

Mentioning what happened to you, hmm, you know, before you roll, just to get people comfortable?

I would never do that.

Ok. Sure.

No, I know. I'll talk to Annapolis.

Mmm.

Well, enjoy the conference, ok?

Hey.

When you took it, when they asked you 121, what'd you answer?

I said yes, all 3 times.

[Telephone rings]

Nora on tape: Hello. You've reached the Durst residence. Please leave a message.

[Beep]

Man: Hi, Nora. It's Rick Carson.

Just wanted to thank you again for being a panelist at this year's Departure-Related Occupations and Practices conference.

Your unique perspective is really valuable to us.

And a heads-up. We're expecting a big crowd this year, so register early.

I'm really looking forward to meeting you in person.

[Beep]

[Overlapping chatter]

[People shouting]

Look in the Bible.

Look right now. Look today!

Man: They're poisoning us!

[People chanting]

Have you seen this?

Man: He's still here.

He's hiding in a basement in Sicily.

Don't trust the Vatican. The pope is still here.

Second man: Any f*cking time now.

f*ck you!

Sons of bitches.

Man: Can't do this to us!

[Bell rings]

Man: Ms. Durst.

You are staying with us for two nights?

Nora: Mm-hmm.

So what's up with all the people outside?

There's a lot more than last year.

Well, you know, anything about the departure for some people.

Can't let it go. Hmm.

This is the hotel's code of conduct. Please read carefully and sign.

We had some issues with your conference last year.

Really? Better cancel the kegger.

Heh heh!

Registration is on the third floor.

Enjoy your stay.

Thank you.

Woman: Ok.

There you go.

Hi.

Nora Durst.

Durst. Great.

Uh...

Here's your welcome bag. Let me look up your badge.

Hey, you want a good cry, read that. He lost 4 people on the 14th.

That's terrible.

Isn't it? Um...

Looks like somebody already picked up your badge.

What? I just got here.

Well, somebody must have picked it up by mistake.

No worries.

This'll get you in to all the events.

Sorry for the confusion, ok?

Next person? Hi. Your name, please?

Williams.

'Scuse me. I'm sorry. I need my badge.

I... I'm a panelist tomorrow.

I work for the Department of Sudden Departure and I'm a legacy.

I'm sorry for your loss.

I'd like to give you a legacy decal to go on your guest badge, but we don't have any left.

No, of course. Thank you.

But you understand that if somebody took my badge...

Well, I'm sure it was just an innocent mistake.

Why don't you go into the mixer? Everyone is in there.

I'm sure your badge is in there, too.

Yes. Next person, please.

[Overlapping chatter]

Man: They can deny it all they want. North Korea lost people.

Second man: We can't ignore the possibility.

Oh! God. Hey there, easy...

""Guest""? [Chuckles]

What's up? Marcus.

I have the most interesting job at the conference.

And I don't believe in name tags.

If you want to know what I do, just ask me.

It's a f*cking madhouse this year.

You might want to watch out for baldy over there.

He's working the room, asking people, ""do you really want to feel this way?""

It's a great f*cking pitch. I give him that.

I mean, who the f*ck wants to feel this way?

I have to go. It was nice meeting you.

Hey, hey, hey, guest.

So you're seriously not gonna ask me what I do?

Ok, what do you do?

You don't want to know what I do.

Ok.

[Scoffing]

Man: We can't deny the rising instances of post-departure delusion disorder.

Or some pundits have cheekily taken to calling it ""the prophet's dilemma.""

For most of humankind's existence, certain individuals have come forth as self-professed interpreters of the world's mysteries.

But what happens when those conversations with God go wrong?

Following a catastrophic event or circumstance, let alone one that defies scientific explanation, the incidence of prophetic delusion rise dramatically.

And this isn't just megalomaniacs who make the news for a week.

This is happening to our friends, our neighbors, our own families.

This belief that a higher power is speaking to us, whether through dreams or signs, even voices, is a powerful coping mechanism, and if left unchecked, it is a very dangerous one.

Woman: Thank you, sir.

I can wait as long as you want.

I am so sorry. I thought you were somebody else.

You don't remember me, do you?

No.

Last year, you called me a heartless bitch at the farewell party.

I don't know... No, that wasn't me.

Yes, it was. Your name is Nora.

You lost your husband and kids.

[Door opens]

You work for Linden-Bix?

I do.

[Door closes]

You said my kids disappeared because I gave them frosted flakes.

No, I mentioned a correlation between eating cereals high in sugar and pre-adolescent departures in a cocktail conversation.

And then you made me cry in front of a roomful of people.

I am sorry. Last year I didn't...

I...

I was having a really hard time.

You're doing so much better now.

Man on intercom: May I have your attention, please?

The breakout session of the Brandenburg carousel has been moved to room 6-b.

6-b in 10 minutes for the Brandenburg carousel. Thank you.

I'll take the next one.

[Elevator bell dings]

[Loud chatter]

Holy shit! It's guest!

Oh, get in here. We haven't seen you.

You know, actually... she's crazy, this one.

I was just going.

No, no, you're not.

You're going up the elevator. Ha ha!

This is wild. Get this, get this.

I gave this young lady my best ""you don't want to know,"" and she still refused to ask me what I do.

Oh, I like her.

Well, guess what, guest? We got you now.

You're coming up to the hospitality suite for drinks.

Thanks, but I have a panel tomorrow, so I...

[all groan]

[Buzzer]

f*ck, Marcus!

No, no, no, no.

You have a choice, guest.

You can play by the rules of this f*cking depressing conference like everybody else, or you can go down the rabbit hole with us.

So what's it gonna be?

You want to spend the next two days of your life dying, one panel at a time, or do you want to live?

[Women giggling]

Oh, ho, ho! Oh, yes!

Man: Oh, poor Patrick Johansen.

It's a f*ck' tragedy, what happened to him, yeah.

Marcus: Four! He lost 4. Did you read the book?

I try not to read anything that comes in a f*ck' tote.

Leave that shit to the oranges.

What's an orange?

Woman: The badges.

You know, some people have the orange stickers?

The legacies?

Legacies, orphans, survivors.

Whatever they want to be called this year. It's awful.

It's a f*cking tragedy.

It's like I'm supposed to treat them better than anyone else?

How many times am I supposed to say I'm sorry, right?

Right, right.

[Sets down bottle]

You pregnant, guest?

What?

Any suicidal thoughts, history of heart problems?

No.

What is this?

Don't worry.

FDA's gonna approve them next year. Have fun.

Woman: Yo, guest! Guest!

Why the f*ck would you work for the DSD?

I like giving people money.

Marcus: Whoa, whoa. All those questions you ask, seriously.

So you really think you're gonna find out why them?

You're gonna crack the case?


[Squeals]

I'm sorry, sir or madam. I'm not qualified to analyze the data from our questionnaires. I don't even have access to it before it goes to our statisticians in Annapolis.

[Laughs, squeals]

Man: It's a f*cking scam.

The insurance companies won't pay out on the departures because they're technically not dead, and then your department created this little questionnaire so that people won't want to collect on their benefits.

Hey, look, if your f*cking dad died in a jet ski accident, right, would you have to answer 150 yes or no questions about what food he liked or whether he had a**l sex?

We do not ask questions about a**l sex. Ha ha ha!

He's f*cking with you, guest.

He's f*cking with you. You do an important job.

We all do an important job, all of us!

Ok. Marcus?

Yes?

What do you do?

All: You don't want to know!

[Laughter]

You know that's my line! That's my line!

I say that. That's my pickup line.

Marcus: Open.

You sell these?

Forty grand a pop.

Our basic models are cheaper, but they're less convincing.

It looks exactly like you.

Down to the appendectomy scar.

We take photos of the departed and home videos, whatever they give us, and then we slowly generate every little thing that made them them.

You know, scars, tattoos, piercings, body hair.

Then, 4 to 6 weeks later, voilà.

They got their loved one back.

You make people pay $40,000 for this?

Uh, heh heh heh!

You think I'm soulless?

You think I'm taking advantage of these poor, grieving people.

But no, no, no, no. They're coming to us, you know?

And... [Scoffs] Look at this.

140 million bodies disappeared.

That's demand.

We are simply providing the supply.

[Sighs] It's pretty amazing, helping someone rebuild the person they lost, bit by bit.

This, they can bury in the ground.

This is here, this, this. This is real.

I want them to have that.

I want them to have something real.

It's a pretty good pitch. I'll give you that.

[Giggles]

So tell me, guest, am I soulless?

No.

You have a soul.

Can I kiss you?

I want to kiss you.

You're married.

I am married.

But I still want to kiss you, and I believe you want to kiss me.

Ok.

What? Ha ha! What are you doing?

[Laughter]

You go, girl.

Man: Check this out.

[All clamoring]

Really? You're making me jealous.

Marcus: This is horrible, horrible.

Don't look at this.

Shh! Shh!

All chanting: Guest! Guest! Guest! Guest! Guest...

[Loud knocking on door]

Man: Nora Durst?

Yes?

Security! Open up! [Coughs]

Open this door now!

I'm coming.

[Knocking continues]

Open up!

Yes?

Nora Durst?

Yes?

You need to pack up your things.

We're escorting you from the hotel.

What?

I don't understand.

You destroyed hotel property.

The mirror in the bar?

I wasn't in the bar.

Let's go, Ms. Durst.

Wait! Stop!

You... listen to me! I wasn't in the bar last night.

Someone took my badge. They're... they're pretending to be me.

See? The conference, they gave me this because my badge was stolen.

That's the person you should be looking for.

They're impersonating me!

I'm not with your conference.

I'm with the hotel. You signed the code of conduct.

You broke it. We want you out. Let's go.

Nora: You can't do this! I didn't do anything wrong!

I have... I have a panel in a few hours!

If we see you on these premises again, we're gonna call the police.

[Door closes]

Morning.

Nora: Thanks for printing those out.

Um, I lost my ID at a conference.

I have to get back for a panel I'm on.

I work for the Department of Sudden Departures.

This is good.

Man: So, Nora Durst, what are you doing back in my hotel with a fake credential and a g*n?

Nora: That's not for... I forgot I had that with me.

I am supposed to be on a panel this morning.

So, why did you throw a bottle at the mirror behind the hotel bar?

I wasn't in the bar.

Someone is impersonating me.

No offense, but who would want to pretend to be you?

I don't know. There are a lot of sick people out there.

Maybe somebody's doing it for attention. I...

My husband and two children are...departed, and that sort of thing, it gets a lot of sympathy.

Jesus, your whole family?

What are the odds?

One in 128,000.

Ok, let's try this on for size. I know how these conferences can be.

Away from home, new people.

So maybe things got out of hand, one drink too many...

Nora: No...

No, no...

Listen to me.

Maybe you did go down to that bar and things got out of control.

Maybe you've been under a lot of stress and you just... lost your grip on things.

Is that possible?

No, that is not possible.

Please, just...

She is probably on my panel right now.

The other panelists don't know me.

She could walk onstage with my badge and nobody would stop her, so please!

All right.

If I walk you down to that conference room and there's no one there pretending to be you, then you leave this hotel and I never see your face again. Deal?

Deal.

[Moderator speaking]

I'm sorry. The session's already started.

We're just gonna be a minute.

Moderator: Next we have Marquee Jackson from Vermont.

Beside him, we have Olivia Livingstone from the Rhode Island branch of the DSD, which has the highest participation rate in the benefit program in the country.

Next, we have Jonathan Van Meter, also from Vermont, and beside him, Nora Durst from New York.

Mrs. Durst is also a triple legacy.

Well, f*ck.

I need two guys to the Waterloo room right now.

Moderator:...Pritcher, liaison with the Canadian departure census, and he'll talk about how they collect their data up north.

And finally, Daniel Mccallum from Connecticut.

Daniel servered on...

Excuse me! I have a question.

Uh, we haven't started the panel yet...

I have a question for Nora Durst.

We will open the floor to questions...

I am not Nora Durst.

[Crowd murmuring]

Impostor: I have been watching you people for the last two days, listening to you, and you are all blind.

Impostor: Puppets.

Moderator: Ma'am.

The Department of the Sudden Departure is an elaborate smokescreen to give the public the illusion of progress.

Ma'am, I'm sorry.

Excuse me.

Their questionnaires are sent to incinerators outside of Tallahassee, Florida.

Shut this off!

Their benefit payments are a way to silence us all.

[Dialogue fading] In 2005, the Israeli Mossad was experimenting with a plasma ray that could target all human matter and leave almost no residue.

Where are your experts and panels on that?

[Impostor's shouting fades out]

Another Martini, dirty.

Thank you.

Let me give you my card. You can keep it open.

Manager says whatever you need, it's on the house.

What'd they do, if the drinks are on them because you've been seriously wronged?

Maybe they're just rewarding me for being a loyal customer.

Nah.

Nah?

Isn't the way the world works.

Indeed it is not.

Heh heh!

Woman: I'm sorry to interrupt.

Would you mind signing this for me?

Oh, absolutely.

Should I make it out to anyone?

Woman: To Gail.

To Gail. Sure.

Please.

No problem.

God bless.

Heh heh! Thank you.

Take care.

What?

I hear it's amazing, your book.

Ah, the writing's so-so.

People respond to the idea.

Why no question mark?

""What's next,"" period.

I mean, no offense, but it's not like you know what's next.

Exactly. No one knows.

But we can't spend our lives waiting around for something that may never come.

Back.

Sorry?

Something that may never come back.

You lost someone?

I did.

You know, my daughter... ahem... about a year ago, she was out in our backyard, chasing around some of her friends, and she was laughing.

Then she saw me watching her and she looked guilty, like she wasn't sure if it was ok to be happy.

But this, what we've experienced...

It isn't grief.

It's never-ending.

Ambiguous loss.

If my 8-year-old can find happiness within, why can't the rest of us?

Bullshit.

I'm sorry?

No, you're not sorry.

Sorry people don't write f*cking books.

Wait a minute. Ma'am, if I've offended you in any way, that was not my...

""Ambiguous loss""? What is ambiguous about your family being gone?

Well, and you must know because you lost what, 4?

You count your parents in that? What were they, in their 70s?

You sit there and tell me a story about your daughter.

I lost everyone.

I lost everything. You f*cking fraud!

You f*cking liar! You're not in pain!

Because if you were in pain, you would know there is no moving on!

There is no happiness! What's next?

What's f*cking next?!

Nothing is next!

Nothing!

Evening.

[People shouting]

Excuse me.

Excuse me. Excuse me.

Miss, miss, miss. I'm sorry to bother you.

I saw you back in the bar and I heard what you said.

And I just wanted to ask you, do you want to feel this way?

Yeah, I want to feel this way. f*ck off.

Man: You're right, you know, about Johansen.

Nora: What? Excuse me.

He's not in pain. He's a fraud, just like you said, and I can prove it.

How?

[Distant baby crying]

[Distant overlapping conversations]

[Door unlocking]

Come on.

[Sniffles]

[Sniffles]

This is Ray. He'll take your payment information.

Payment for what?

Oh, last year Patrick Johansen, he walked through doorways just like that.

If you want to know what happened, it's $1,000.

What do you mean, ""what happened""?

Ray: You on PayPal?

If not, I can get you set up.

I have an account.

Ray: Go ahead and pull it up.

You authorize the amount.

[Typing]

Thank you.

Now right this way.

Go ahead.

Come on.

This is Wayne.

Holy Wayne.

Mmm, I don't think she's heard of me.

No, she's here about Patrick Johansen.

Who?

The one who came to you just before you left for the ranch?

Lost most of his family?

He ended up writing a book?

Oh, right.

Right. I didn't read it.

I assume he didn't mention me.

Why would he mention you?

Because I took his pain from him.

What are you doing?

What's your name, love?

Nora.

Nora.

Nora, I don't give a shit about you.

I've already got your money, and I'm f*cking exhausted.

You've lost someone, yes?

Someones.

And you believe that you will always feel that pain.

And if it starts to slip away, you... you seek it out again, don't you?

You won't let it k*ll you, but you won't...

k*ll yourself.

[Sobs]

For whoever is joined with all of the living, there is hope.

Surely, a live dog is better than a dead lion.

Hope.

It's your weakness.

You want it gone because you don't deserve it.

[Crying]

Nora...

You do deserve hope.

I've seen my own death, and it's coming upon me very soon, so this is your one chance, your only chance, and the question remains the same.

Do you want to feel this way?

No.

No.

[Whimpers]

Then let me take it from you.

Will I forget them?

Never.

[Sobbing]

[Whimpers]

[Wailing]

[Children shouting]

[Scanner beeping]

You have a rewards card with us?

Sure, I got it right here.

Nora on tape: Hello, you've reached the Durst residence. Please leave a message.

[Beep] Matt: Nora.

Hi, uh, it's Matt.

I know I keep calling. I should just...

I don't know how many different ways I could apologize I. I've made some changes in my life.

I see things more clearly now.

We're family.

I love you. [Beep]

Woman's voice on tape: Message saved.

[Doorbell rings]

Hey.

Hi.

I, uh...

Looked up your address.

Actually easier to get than your phone number, believe it or not.

Oh, did you want to come in or...

No, actually, I'm on duty. I, uh... just wanted to stop by and tell you I don't take it personally.

You know, when you said, uh, ""f*ck your daughter.""

I was having an off day.

Divorces will do that to you.

They will. [Both chuckle]

Anyway, I just wanted you to know that I want to get out here all the time, just go, but when you said that about Miami, it sounded pretty good.

Maybe we should, um... do dinner or something first sometime?

I would love that.

Good.

All right. [Chuckles]

But you should know, though, I'm a f*ck' mess.

Thanks for the heads-up.

All right.

[Chuckles] Bye.

Bye.

Nora: To your knowledge, did the departed regularly use aerosol hair spray and/or deodorant?

Yeah, I think so.

In your opinion, was the departed a charitable person?

Yes.

In your opinion, was the departed a religious person?

Yes.

In your opinion, do you believe the departed is in a better place?

No.

This is the story of a... a little boy.

I'd say, ""Stop me if you've heard this one before,"" but you have, and I don't really want to be stopped.

This boy, he's a good kid; not perfect, but good, and when he's about 10 years old, his mom and dad tell him he's gonna have a baby sister.

And the baby sister comes, and of course he loves her very much.

But... she's getting attention.

His attention.

So he wishes... actually... he prays for that attention back and... a month later, he's diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia.

[Cooing]

And the... [sighs]... cancer eats away at the boy until there is almost nothing left.

But he fights it.

He survives and... now he has a choice to make.

Does he decide that he was punished or that he was rewarded?

Will he be angry for having been made to suffer, or will he be grateful for that suffering because... it changed him?

This is the story of a little girl.

She's 8 years old, and just over a week ago, she's playing in the park.

She loves to go high on the swings, up to the point where you hang there for a moment, suspended, before the chains clink and gravity pulls you back down.

She's been asleep... in a coma, for 9 days now.

Her brain activity is negligible.

Her outcome is undetermined.

The girl's name is Emily... and so that little boy is asking for attention again now.

For Emily, let us pray.

Heavenly Father, You invite all who are burdened to come to You.

Allow Your healing hand to touch this girl.

Fill her heart with Your courage and infinite love for all that you create...

Jill!

Where the hell were you last night?

At a friend's.

What friend?

Does it matter? What are you doing?

I told you not to come here.

I want to be here.

I don't give a shit what you want.

Why was there a dead dog in your trunk?

Shit.

Good morning, everyone.

All: Good morning.

So many of our loved ones were lost 3 years ago, and it's hard to know how to talk about them without feeling... well, we really don't know how to feel because we still wonder where they went and why.

We honor them now with this remembrance...

Mapleton's own October 14th memorial.

Hector, would you please?

Every one of us was touched by the events of October 14th, but no one more than our honored speaker, Nora Durst.

Man: All right.

Woman: Come on, Nora. All right.

Come on, Nora.

Nora.

[Applause subsides]

The best day of my life happened a few months before October 14th, but I didn't know it.

It just seemed like, um, a nice day, you know, all four of us at the beach: my husband, my 6-year-old son, and my 4-year-old daughter.

Their names were... are Doug, Jeremy, and Erin.

The kids built a sand castle.

Doug and I, we just sat on a blanket and watched them work, and it was just... perfect, and... it felt like, um...

I didn't deserve anything that... good.

Nora: This one Saturday, the winter before that, we all got hit with the stomach flu, the whole family.

We were all feverish and throwing up, and I couldn't even get out of bed, and... the kids were lying there with us, and I could feel the heat coming off their bodies, and I remember thinking, ""This is it,"" I was gonna die.

I'm not greedy.

I'm not asking for that perfect day at the beach.

[Chuckles]

Just give me that horrible Saturday, all four of us sick and miserable, but alive and together.

Woman: Do not talk about this as if it has something to do with what we have and have not done, as if there is some sort of rule book...

Everybody knows that the holy word of God...

You're talking about the Bible.

We're trying to have a secular conversation here, and you want to talk about God's will.

If it's not the will of God, whose will is it?

It is no one's. It is arbitrary.

It is meaningless, and anyone who suggests otherwise is probably trying to start his own cult.

I'll tell you who's starting a cult... the scientists who believe in worshiping their own objectivity.

Science. Science always.

Empirical evidence always rules.

There is no atheist apostle.

Einstein said that God doesn't play dice with the universe!

Spiritual explanations for that which you cannot explain.

God brings along the peace...

Arbitrary, meaningless.
